# Project Gantt Plan

**Baseline date:** 2026-08-18
**Owner:** project author  
**Control source:** [`spec/SPEC.md` §13](../spec/SPEC.md#13-schedule--gates)  
**Fixed review windows:** First 2026-08-18–22; Second 2026-09-29–10-03; Final 2026-11-17–21
**Final report and supporting material:** 2026-11-20

This is the maintained PR-2 time-plan artifact. `spec/SPEC.md` governs sequence and gates if this chart ever disagrees. Engineering checkpoints W0–W4 were completed ahead of the nominal teaching-week windows; the remaining bars preserve the normative gate order. Dates show the planned windows; status reflects authenticated repository evidence, not percentage estimates.

**Planning correction (2026-08-18):** the G-8 work is shown as its actual
three-phase path—G8_E, G8_F, then G8_G—before later learned-system work. The
planned downstream windows are resequenced to expose those dependencies; the
fixed review/report dates and every authenticated status remain unchanged.

**2026-08-25: status refresh** — phase markers corrected against the
authoritative current-path block in [`NEXT.md`](../NEXT.md): G8_C/G8_D complete,
G8_E GREEN and closed through E7 (E2 288000/288000 verified; pass one frozen at
378/378 cells), G8_F/F1 in progress under the active Pascal F0-v3 freeze;
everything from F2 onward remains honestly unfinished/planned.

## 3. Critical path and control rules

The scientific critical path is:

`G8_C → G8_D tooling → G8_E validation/pass one → G8_F artifact-classifier training/pass two → G8_G final G-8 ratio/adjudication → W5 learned-system training → G-4 λ calibration → W8 final training → G-10/G-11 → validation rehearsal → G-12 test release → G-5 Tier 1 freeze → report figures`.

Control rules:

1. **No downstream work crosses a gate.** G8_E full validation measurement and pass-one selection begin only after E0; G8_F waits for the immutable G8_E pass-one state; G8_G waits for the immutable G8_F pass-two state; learned-system training, calibration, final training and test access remain behind their later gates.
2. **The test split stays sealed until G-12.** Review demonstrations use validation data and are labelled accordingly.
3. **Hardware purchase is conditional on G-5.** Failure at G-5 abandons Tier 2/3 and moves effort to reporting.
4. **W16 is allocated contingency, not feature capacity.** It absorbs report completion and results-audit variance.
5. **Review dates do not move.** If scientific work slips, the review reports the actual state; it does not bypass a gate to manufacture a figure.
6. **The chart is revised at each review.** Changes record baseline date, changed bar, cause, effect on the critical path, and accepted fallback.
7. **First Review does not gate on later experiments.** G8_E, G8_F, G8_G, learned training/results, demo, thesis, poster, plagiarism workflow, hardware purchase and SDR work remain later tasks. Review 1 reports G8_C and G8_D as complete and the remaining work as future work rather than accelerating, weakening or bypassing a gate for presentation evidence.

## 4. Review checkpoints

| Review | Fixed window | Minimum evidence shown | Review purpose |
|---|---:|---|---|
| First | 18–22 Aug | All six rubric categories; problem/literature synthesis; completion objectives; exact corrected H1 rule; maintained Gantt; standards/tools register; G-1/G-2/G-7/W4 evidence; current G8_C/G8_D status; deployment path | Assess the motivation, proposal, subject understanding and practical execution plan |
| Second | 29 Sep–3 Oct | Frozen validation curves; G-10 crossover disposition; ER-9 design; validation-strength rehearsal; revised Gantt | Review progress, results-driven methodology and any permitted objective restatement |
| Final | 17–21 Nov | Frozen test results; hypothesis decisions; attribution control; demo; report/poster/supporting evidence | Final assessment and viva |

## 5. Current quantitative evidence available to the First Review

These are observed repository records, not forecasts:

- G-1: Imagenette-160 clean validation top-1 accuracy `898/1000 = 0.898`, above the `0.88` floor.
- G-7: the 1.64 M-parameter DJSCC profile ran a full 8,469-image epoch at batch size 32 in 48.68 s, reserving 1.004 GiB VRAM; 100 epochs projected to 1.35 h on the profiled device.
- G-2: golden vectors and all three independent BLER waterfall comparisons passed the 0.5 dB tolerance.
- W4: a bounded end-to-end classical run and its source-bound verifier pass; the full G-8 validation sweep has not run.
- G8_C is complete: the Pascal successor covers 3,213/3,213 identities and its measured-only BLER table is frozen. G8_D tooling is GREEN and complete (D0–D7). G8_E is GREEN and closed through E7 with the validation campaign verified at 288000/288000 and pass one frozen at 378/378 cells. G8_F is in progress under the frozen Pascal F0-v3 authorization, with F1 corpus materialization running externally; artifact-classifier training/pass two, G8_G final ratio adjudication, later learned-system training and test access remain unfinished.

No learned-vs-classical headline result exists yet. The First Review must not present bounded smoke data as a scientific comparison.
