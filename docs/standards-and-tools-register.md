# Engineering Standards and Tools Register

**Register baseline:** 2026-08-14
**Normative source:** [`spec/SPEC.md`](../spec/SPEC.md)  
**Environment pins:** [`spec/params.generated.yaml`](../spec/params.generated.yaml) and [`requirements.lock`](../requirements.lock)

This register satisfies PR-3. It distinguishes a claimed conformance boundary from contextual standards and implementation tools. A library implementing part of a standard does not make the whole system standards-conformant.

## 1. Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **C** | Claimed and tested conformance within the stated boundary |
| **I** | Implementation dependency with a frozen version or authenticated source |
| **R** | Informative reference; used to define terms or compare behavior |
| **P** | Planned tool or interface; not yet selected/frozen |
| **X** | Explicitly outside the project's conformance claim |

## 2. Communications and codec standards

| Standard | Edition/pin | Status | Project use and exact boundary | Verification/evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| [3GPP TS 38.212, *NR; Multiplexing and channel coding*](https://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/38212.htm) | Release 17, v17.13.0, dated 2026-02 | **C** | Transport-block CRC24A; code-block segmentation; CRC24B; BG1/BG2 selection; lifting-size selection; filler handling; 5G NR LDPC encoding, rate matching, and recovery. Project code performs transport-block framing and segmentation; Sionna provides the registered LDPC primitives. | Bit-exact project-owned vectors; authenticated srsRAN release vectors; independent packetisation arithmetic over all 216 registered configurations; G-2 BLER adjudication. |
| [3GPP TS 38.211, *NR; Physical channels and modulation*](https://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/38211.htm) | Release 17 context | **R/X** | Used as context for constellation terminology. Tier 1 maps generic BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM onto an abstract complex AWGN channel. It does **not** implement an NR slot, resource grid, synchronization signal, reference signals, or waveform. | The published claim names abstract AWGN and excludes full-link NR conformance. |
| [3GPP TS 38.214, *NR; Physical layer procedures for data*](https://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/38214.htm) | Release 17 context | **X** | No NR MCS table, transport-block-size procedure, scheduling, HARQ, or resource allocation is claimed. Codec quality, code rate, and modulation are research-grid choices under a fixed complex-symbol budget. | Explicit exclusion in `params.baseline.standards_claim_excludes`. |
| [ITU-T T.800, *JPEG 2000 image coding system: Core coding system*](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.800) / ISO/IEC 15444-1 | Codec implementation fixed to OpenJPEG 2.5.4 | **C/I** | JPEG 2000 is the source codec of record. The project emits a raw codestream, uses the irreversible 9/7 wavelet, controls compression by ratio, and accounts for every emitted byte. | OpenJPEG version preflight occurs before artifact creation; byte-accounting and cache-identity tests; bounded W4 evidence. |
| [ITU-T T.81, *Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images*](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.81) / ISO/IEC 10918-1 | Pillow 12.3.0 binding | **R** | Baseline JPEG is retained only as a labelled secondary sensitivity curve. It is not the headline codec because container overhead can dominate the smallest channel budgets. | Separate codec identity and cache key; no substitution for JPEG 2000. |
| [IEEE 754-2019, *Floating-Point Arithmetic*](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/754/6210/) | Host/toolchain implementation | **R** | Defines the arithmetic context for NumPy/PyTorch calculations. The project does not claim cross-device bit-identical floating-point training; it claims seeded procedures, recorded environments, tolerances, and exact identity for serialized contract bytes. | Environment record plus CPU exact-hash and GPU same-seed tolerance policies. |
| [RFC 2119, *Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels*](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) | March 1997 | **R** | `MUST`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` semantics used by the project specification and phase contracts. | Spec parser and generated concern views preserve requirement text. |
| [ISO 8601-1:2019, date and time representations](https://www.iso.org/standard/70907.html) | UTC timestamp convention | **R** | Human-readable execution and adjudication timestamps use ISO-8601/RFC-3339-compatible forms where the artifact schema calls for them. | Schema validators reject malformed or missing required fields; cryptographic identity does not rely on wall-clock time. |

### 2.1 Permitted standards claim

The defensible short claim is, verbatim as `params.baseline.standards_claim`
(PF-3 requires the sentence to appear verbatim in this register):

> a TS 38.212-derived 5G NR LDPC coding and rate-matching core, with custom byte-framed payloads and generic BPSK/QPSK/16-QAM over abstract AWGN

JPEG 2000 coding is provided by OpenJPEG 2.5.4. The claim must always be accompanied by the exclusions: no TS 38.214 transport-block/MCS procedure, scheduling, HARQ, resource allocation, OFDM resource mapping, NR synchronization/pilots, waveform generation, π/2-BPSK, or full 5G NR link conformance.

## 3. Software tools and libraries

| Tool | Frozen/current version | Status | Purpose | Control |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Python | 3.14.6 | **I** | Project runtime and tooling language | Fixed in `params.environment.python_version`; recorded in run metadata |
| PyTorch | 2.13.0+cu130; CPU lane 2.13.0+cpu | **I** | Models, training, tensors, CUDA execution | Hashed CUDA and CPU lockfiles; CUDA build assertion in primary environment |
| torchvision | 0.28.0+cu130; CPU lane 0.28.0+cpu | **I** | ResNet-18 and image operations | Same index/pin policy as PyTorch |
| Sionna | `sionna-no-rt==2.0.1` | **I** | 5G NR LDPC base graphs, lifting/encoding, rate matching/recovery, offset-min-sum decoding | Adapter seam; version pin; golden vectors; independent BLER reference |
| NumPy | 2.5.1 | **I** | Array operations, PCG64 identities, evidence serialization support | Hashed lock; seed/domain separation contracts |
| Pillow | 12.3.0 | **I** | Image decode and secondary JPEG codec | Hashed lock; dataset-specific decode rules |
| scikit-image | 0.26.0 | **I** | PSNR/SSIM metric support | Hashed lock; metric constants loaded from generated parameters |
| glymur | 0.14.3 | **I** | Python binding to OpenJPEG | Hashed lock; loaded codec version independently checked |
| OpenJPEG | 2.5.4 | **I** | JPEG 2000 encode/decode | External system dependency; exact loaded version checked before any J2K artifact path exists |
| PyYAML | 6.0.3 | **I** | Generated-parameter and tooling configuration parsing | Included in both full and CPU locks so exact sync cannot remove spec tooling |
| pytest | 9.1.1 | **I** | Behavioral, mutation, conformance, provenance, and gate tests | Hashed lock; marker taxonomy separates real external requirements |
| uv | >=0.11 for resolution | **I** | Generate hashed lockfiles with recorded index URLs | `unsafe-best-match` and `--emit-index-url` are required; runtime remains plain-pip installable |
| Git | Repository history | **I** | Source identity, immutable checkpoint history, release ancestry | Evidence binds commits and/or source-byte SHA-256 according to artifact role |
| GitHub / GitHub Actions | Workflow actions pinned by commit SHA | **I** | Remote durability, release assets, small hosted CI lanes | CI classifies changes; scientific evidence remains verified offline from committed artifacts |
| Streamlit | Version not yet frozen | **P** | W13 local demonstration UI | Selection and lockfile entry occur only when DR-1–DR-6 implementation starts |
| GNU Radio / SoapySDR or vendor API | Not selected | **P** | Optional Tier 2 SDR framing, synchronization, and replay | Selection is gated by G-5 and hardware availability; no current Tier 1 dependency |

## 4. Data, model, and evidence controls

These are project engineering controls rather than external standards, but they are load-bearing:

| Control | Registered implementation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset provenance | Exact archive byte length and SHA-256; canonical tracked split manifests | `tools/fetch_datasets.py --check`, manifest materialization, provenance-only test scan |
| Test isolation | Sole guarded boundary in `src/data/test_access.py`; release at G-12 | AST import-graph test and per-artifact zero-access counters |
| Randomness | Domain-separated keyed identities for initialization, data order, channel noise, and artifacts | Exact-key and control-flow-invariance tests |
| Configuration | Runtime reads generated YAML; `config_hash` is a versioned complete fingerprint | Literal lint and schema validation |
| Evidence identity | Canonical JSON, SHA-256, byte length, source manifest, contract IDs | Offline verifiers and mutation tests |
| Crash recovery | Atomic publication, per-unit locks, predecessor digests, exact resumable prefixes | G8 B2C/B3 contracts and adversarial tests |
| Statistical analysis | Paired image-level outcomes, preregistered confidence method, failure rows retained | Final ER-1/ER-10 analysis after G-12 |

## 5. Hardware and laboratory register

| Item | Current state | Role | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU | Available and profiled | Training and full-strength simulation | CUDA 13.0 PyTorch build; driver 592.82 recorded in evidence |
| Dedicated Pascal worker: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11 GB) + TITAN Xp (12 GB) | **Qualified** as execution profile `confessor_pascal_cu126` (2026-08-25 status; see §5.1) | Production scientific execution — completed the G8_C successor campaign (3,213/3,213 identities), G8_E E2–E7, and is the sole writer for the owner-authorized G8_F/F1 corpus materialization | Separate hashed `requirements-pascal.lock` (Python 3.14.6, torch 2.13.0+cu126); sole-writer discipline; profile frozen per run before first measurement |
| Dedicated-worker Intel NVMe controller | Enumerated by user-supplied `lspci`; capacity/filesystem not yet measured | Candidate local datasets, caches and checkpoints | Confirm mounted capacity, free space and health before delegation; `lspci` cannot exclude additional SATA disks |
| WSL2 `/dev/dxg` CUDA path | Available | GPU access boundary | A visible adapter is insufficient; PyTorch CUDA initialization is the acceptance test |
| HackRF One + RTL-SDR pair | Candidate only | Optional transmit/receive SDR replay | No purchase before G-5; at least 1 Msps required; candidate capability must be rechecked before procurement |
| SMA attenuator/cable chain | Candidate only | Conducted loopback and safe receiver level | Must be specified before connecting transmitter to receiver; antenna-free bench replay preferred |
| Raspberry Pi 4/5-class host | Candidate only | Optional Tier 3 edge demo | Attempt only if Tier 2 lands; otherwise prerecorded demonstration is the mandated fallback |

### 5.1 Dedicated Pascal worker finding — 2026-08-14

> **2026-08-25 status (supersedes the directives below, which are preserved as history):**
> the node was subsequently qualified exactly along the path this finding anticipated — a
> separate hashed CUDA 12.6 lane (`requirements-pascal.in` → `requirements-pascal.lock`:
> Python **3.14.6**, `torch==2.13.0+cu126`, `torchvision==0.28.0+cu126`) was added rather than
> replacing the CUDA 13 lane, both GPUs were qualified, and execution profile
> `confessor_pascal_cu126` is now frozen and authoritative alongside `local_4060_cu130`.
> The "do not execute or resume" directive below is moot: G8_C completed on this profile at
> 3,213/3,213 identities, its successor BLER table is frozen from those measurements, G8_E ran
> E2–E7 on it GREEN/closed, and it is currently the sole writer for the owner-authorized
> G8_F/F1 corpus materialization. The dependency-guard observation about
> `_authenticate_dependencies()` remains true as stated; the conclusion drawn from it applied to
> a pre-qualification moment that has passed. The delegation decision recorded as open in the
> final paragraph was made: the node is adopted for production scientific execution.

The worker's user-supplied PCI enumeration confirms a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti at
`3b:00.0`, a TITAN Xp at `d8:00.0`, and an Intel NVMe controller at `5e:00.0`.
The GPUs are Pascal compute-capability 6.1 devices. CUDA Toolkit 13 removed offline compilation and
library support for Pascal. The researched compatible project lane is Python
3.12 with `torch 2.9.1+cu126` and `torchvision 0.24.1+cu126`. The node is therefore technically viable through a
separate CUDA 12.6 lane, subject to an on-node driver, CUDA initialization,
real-kernel, dependency, deterministic-parity and memory qualification. See
the [CUDA 13 release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/13.0.0/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html)
and the [official PyTorch CUDA 12.6 wheel index](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126/torch/).

That technical viability does **not** authorize the node for the current G8_C
campaign. The registered
[`bler_runner_contract.json`](../results/baseline/g8/bler_runner_contract.json)
records `torch 2.13.0+cu130` and Torch CUDA 13.0, and the active accepted suffix
was produced on the recorded RTX 4060 path. G8_C's physical-layer algorithm
does not inherently require CUDA 13, and its device and batch size are declared
provenance-only by the epoch-2 coordinator. However,
[`AuthenticatedRunnerContext._authenticate_dependencies()`](../src/baseline/g8_bler_runner.py)
currently verifies the exact NumPy and Sionna versions but checks PyTorch only
for a non-null CUDA build. A CUDA 12.6 build could therefore pass that runtime
guard while contradicting the dependency versions recorded by the registered
runner contract and the normative SR-21 environment pin. Treat this as a
fail-closed provenance boundary: **do not execute or resume the live G8_C suffix
on the Pascal worker and do not mix CUDA 12.6 results into its evidence.**

Delegation is intentionally undecided. At the next cold start, decide whether
to qualify and use the node and, if so, for which future phase. Before any
scientific delegation, inventory its OS, Python, NVIDIA driver, mounted NVMe
capacity/free space and remote-access path; prove CUDA initialization and a
real kernel on each GPU; verify dependency and deterministic parity; and agree
how artifacts return to the authenticated repository. If it is adopted for
later W5 training, first record the environment change through the
specification's append-only amendment process, add a separate hashed CUDA 12.6
lock rather than replacing the CUDA 13 lane, qualify both GPUs, and define
which hardware/environment fields enter run identity and metadata. No
environment, campaign, contract, delegation or scientific result is changed
by recording this finding.

The complete read-only impact audit and cold-start debate questions are in
[`audit/pascal-worker-adoption-audit-2026-08-14.md`](../audit/pascal-worker-adoption-audit-2026-08-14.md).

## 6. Register maintenance

Update this file when any standard boundary, version pin, implementation library, or hardware interface changes. A scientific requirement or parameter change additionally needs an append-only amendment in `spec/SPEC.md`; updating this register alone is insufficient. At each review:

1. compare every version with `spec/params.generated.yaml` and the lockfiles;
2. verify that claimed standards have an executable check;
3. downgrade any unverified claim to reference/planned status;
4. add newly selected demo or hardware tools; and
5. retain explicit exclusions so a subsystem claim cannot be read as end-to-end conformance.
