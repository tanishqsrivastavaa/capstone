# Very Next Steps

**Working file for hand-off between sessions.** Short-lived, frequently rewritten, deliberately
scrappy. Read it first at the start of a session; update it before finishing one.

Not normative — `spec/SPEC.md` governs. If something here contradicts the spec, the spec wins and
this file is wrong. Anything here that turns out to be a durable decision belongs in `SPEC.md`
(as a `DEC`), a durable risk belongs in `SPEC.md` §16, and an explanation belongs in `docs/`.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-25 · **Phase:** **G8_F/F0-v3 is GREEN and Pascal-bound; the separate F1-only owner launch authorization is frozen and the exact `confessor` sole-writer campaign is the live external frontier. G8_E is GREEN and CLOSED through E7. The

Separately, the ci-cpu lane was repaired host-independently (commit `824d49c`;
GitHub Actions run `32579946365` green). AM-87 resolves support breadth and remains immutable at 120 exact deduplicated
artifact qualities over all 8,469 eligible training IDs. AM-88 now supersedes
only its exhaustive Cartesian execution multiplicity: metadata-only balanced
sampler plan `g8fsamplerplan-d6d64ead5295b93c2a73aefd5f0719dd438bd6c0425286a33a31f1fba3ff64d6`

assigns exactly six distinct supported qualities per training image, 50,814
attempts total, with global and per-class quality-count range at most one. It
materialized zero objects itself. The owner independently accepted AM-88 and
authorized F0 only. F0-v1 `g8ff0auth-92189865…` / SHA `17a88e36…` remains byte-identical
historical evidence and is superseded-before-F1 after an independent audit found
incomplete resume/object authentication. F0-v2 `g8ff0v2auth-dbcac1f…` / SHA
`b14691ca…` also remains byte-identical and is superseded-before-F1 with zero
coverage solely for the owner-selected profile relocation; no scientific
protocol changed. Active F0-v3 `g8ff0v3auth-e261cd53…` / SHA `391cd815…` binds

`confessor_pascal_cu126`, Torch `cuda:0` TITAN Xp UUID `GPU-46acd0f2…`, Pascal
lock SHA `d3561c8e…`, and exact AM-88. Separate F1-only owner launch
`g8ff1launch-a88fc237…` / SHA `4265b696…` is frozen. The external runtime on
`confessor` is authoritative for F1 progress. F2/classifier training,
inference/pass two, fallback, ratio adjudication, learned training and test
remain closed.**

**2026-08-23 G8_E E5–E7 closeout (COMPLETE):** the takeover prompt was the
owner's explicit E5–E7 authorization. Prerequisites were re-authenticated, not
recomputed: E2 completion SHA `442448a424cbad0ead742c4a45724155486cd2e8ecefeff52bff62394e5096a6`,
E3 `g8ee3v3-ec7b28fd…` SHA `8496ebdb…`, E4 `g8ee4v3-4b5206cb…` SHA `ee269346…`
(288 eligible objects × denominator 1000; outcome mix delivered 264,000 /
codec-infeasible 24,000 / decode-failure 0 / structural 0), W4 adjudication
`58827922…` with its preregistered selection-policy fingerprint recomputed from
the live module, successor BLER table `g8pblertable-69ecc729…` loaded through
the portable loader, complete candidate/BLER coverage proven before execution
(18,732 block lookups, zero uncharacterized). The typed sweep authorization is
constructed at its single sanctioned site `tests/g8_e5_gate.py` because PB_3's
AST scan (and the frozen bytes binding it) pins construction to tests/ only;
the scan still proves no non-test file constructs one. Pass-one selections map
1:1 back to logical candidate-authority IDs for the G8_F corpus lineage.

**2026-08-24 G8_F AM-88 balanced sampler (PROTOCOL PLAN FROZEN; EXECUTION ZERO):**
AM-87's 120-quality support and 8,469 training-ID eligibility are unchanged.
Frozen seed `am88-g8f-balanced-sampler-20260824-v1`, sampler
`g8_f_balanced_sampler_v1`, assigns six distinct qualities per image through one
seed-keyed quality permutation and continuous class-ordered cyclic chunks.
Exact attempts 50,814 (20× below AM-87), global counts 423–424, every class
range 0–1, duplicate pairs 0, validation/test IDs 0. Ordered/set pair SHA-256:
`c7c29729…` / `255eab85…`. Typed codec infeasibility omits without resampling;
all unexpected failures HOLD. No F1 benchmark ran; existing planning basis
scales to 6.10 h expected / 7.03 h maximum-window extrapolations and 5.08 GB
expected / 5.86 GB maximum storage. Plan `g8fsamplerplan-d6d64ead…`, audit:
`audit/g8-f-balanced-sampler-am88-2026-08-24.md`. The owner audit accepted
AM-88; F0 is now frozen and a separate F1 launch remains next.

**2026-08-23 G8_F / BR-12 breadth repair (AM-87 SUPPORT FROZEN; CARTESIAN MULTIPLICITY SUPERSEDED BY AM-88):**
The old “preregistered feasible quality band” was proven non-executable after
pass one and before F0: it supplied no quality tuple, band axis/width,
feasibility level, projection, ordering, deduplication, PHY multiplicity or
per-image failure rule. AM-87 honestly records that timing and rejects a new
winner-centred width as outcome-adaptive. The corrected rule uses immutable
pass-one references only for AM-6's original dataset/ratio scope at/below the
training SNR, expands through the pre-pass-one candidate/measurement authority,
projects to `(dataset, source codec, payload budget, encode axis, codec
configuration ID)`, and takes the complete deduplicated set. Frozen plan
`results/baseline/g8_f/corpus_plan.json` has 120 qualities, 8,469 exact training
IDs and 1,016,280 quality-major attempts; E4's 104 observed-artifact / 16
all-codec-infeasible quality counts estimate cost only and do not choose
membership. A typed per-image codec infeasibility omits and records the pair
without substitution; every other failure is HOLD. G8_C/G8_D/G8_E/pass one are
unchanged, corpus objects/training/pass two/test remain zero, and no Pascal
worker was started. Audit:
`audit/g8-f-corpus-breadth-repair-2026-08-23.md`. Its support remains current;
its Cartesian multiplicity and old owner-audit cursor are superseded by AM-88.

**2026-08-23 clean-checkout test-harness incident (CONTAINED):** the full-local
gate in `/home/nick/projects/capstone-ci-clean` exposed that
`test_production_runner_refuses_old_v2_and_missing_authorization_before_payload`
relied on the writer-only ignored runtime to force `--start` refusal. In the
clean worktree it unintentionally created a separate unauthorized corrected-v3
runtime at exact durable prefix 42704/288000 before being stopped. Training and
test access remain zero. The preserved local predecessor runtime independently
re-authenticates unchanged at 47409/288000; the trees share zero file inodes,
and the predecessor's newest mtime predates the incident. The scratch runtime is
zero-coverage, permanently merge-ineligible custody evidence: do not resume,
merge, delete or normalize it, and do not use that worktree for scientific
execution. The test now uses isolated `tmp_path` roots, missing authorization
and explicit payload/transaction barriers. Full record:
`audit/g8-e-clean-checkout-runtime-incident-2026-08-23.md`.

**2026-08-22 worker-successor E2/E3/E4 closeout (COMPLETE):** production E2 ran to
exact 288000/288000 under campaign `g8e-v3s-85354d3db97c74adfd01bc1c5fe2148e05dfebfb0d832229a3bce5ca10ebf588`

commit `493d656`). The frozen v3s lifecycle wrappers could not execute post-completion
verification (they passed the contract's seven-key data-identity summary block where
the pre-registered rule requires the full scientific-data-identity FILE); this was
repaired additively with no bound-byte change — repair provenance

288 eligible objects × validation denominator 1000, record traversal 288,000.
Codec-infeasible records (24,000) each carry one BR-13 constant-class outage
prediction with binary counts; candidates are not erased and denominators are
unchanged. Custody record:
`results/baseline/g8_e/e2_confessor_successor/closeout_provenance.json`
(`g8ecloseout-1422804d…`). Canonical publication: the three immutable lifecycle
artifacts are tracked at their frozen runtime paths (`runtime/e2_completion.json`,
`runtime/e3_exact_set_closure.json`, `runtime/e4_count_derived.json`); the rest of
the 15-GiB runtime stays worker-local on `confessor`. Next: **owner-audited
E5/pass-one authorization only**;
do not execute pass one without it.

**2026-08-21 G8_E corrected-v3 repair (complete):** starting parity was clean
at `3ce42677464be4aa54de789f5d97e23aaec59b2c`. Before any production source
edit, corrected-v2 independently verified with zero accepted records, zero
completed units, no runtime, no owner authorization, no E3/E4 and every
pass/training/fallback/ratio/test boundary closed. The additive current epoch is
`results/baseline/g8_e/e1_corrected_v3/`: contract
`g8econtractcorrectedv3-da3e1d32d5b826a5bfa06f0d7b7a9e3c1809026843633648d28a70a9437986a4`,
campaign `g8e-v3-c20d9c4f4638687ad9e4e3e69bf7b9dbdf509a62c2c3a4d95dbbe6771ced57b5`,
source manifest `g8esourcecorrectedv3-116a394b0edf1df29ff09244457c45f36f747952094840a6701bfcdfebb29b44`,
source commit `0ec81dd0130d2caab485065592afc12433b176f2`. Its lifecycle layering,
linear transaction/E3/E4, exact manifest/class/source identity, cache
authentication, storage plan and synthetic entry-point proof pass. Corrected-v2
is preserved as `superseded-before-data`; no real authorization/runtime/E2/E3/E4
exists. Next: owner-audited E2 authorization/execution only. Do not perform it
without the owner artifact.

**2026-08-19 G8_E E1 corrective supersession (complete):** the first E1
freeze was proven unopened before this repair: its runtime root, E2 records,
pass markers, G8_F state and scientific counters are absent or zero. Its
contract, campaign, authority and source-manifest identities remain immutable
history and are classified `superseded-before-data`; no measurement was
invalidated. The additive corrected epoch froze the logical/structural authority
and physical cache boundary, but was later superseded before data by the v2
repair. The corrected-v2 epoch froze the complete future E2 transaction
plus deterministic E3/E4 transformations, including image-level outage rows,
fatal runtime HOLD behavior, compact O(1) advancement and a real start/resume
state machine, but the v3 repair superseded it before data. The v2 runner is
historical and must not execute. Do not execute E2, decode the
full validation set, run pass one, train, invoke fallback, adjudicate ratios or
access test.

**2026-08-19 G8_E corrected-v2 supersession (complete):** the first corrected
E1 epoch was audited before data and has zero accepted production records,
zero completed units, no E3/E4 output and no owner authorization. It remains
immutable `superseded-before-data` history. This now-historical v2 epoch is
`results/baseline/g8_e/e1_corrected_v2/`; its production-scale contract binds
6,048 logical Imagenette cells, 288 structural identities and 288,000 work
units, with zero coverage and no runtime. It repairs per-image codec
infeasibility scoring, unexpected-exception HOLD semantics, compact transaction
state, start/resume separation, classifier-observation reuse and direct G8_C/G8_D
provenance. Corrected-v3 superseded it before data; E2 is still unopened and
owner authorization has not been created.

**2026-08-18 clean-checkout provenance repair (complete):** the G8_C request,
result, state and campaign-state bytes, authority, 5,000-trial counts, BLER
values and frozen `BlerTable` are unchanged. The failure was a metadata-only
implementation/provenance-verifier defect: the historical normalized tar tree
digest included filesystem modes and ignored coordination paths, so it was not
round-trippable through Git. Clean-checkout authentication now uses
`results/baseline/g8_pascal_successor/portable_scientific_runtime_manifest.json`
and its strict loader, which binds only scientific paths, lengths and exact-byte
SHA-256 values and independently reconstructs all 3,213 points. The legacy
tree digest remains historical provenance. G8_D D0–D7 was reverified and
non-scientifically rebound; no campaign or validation measurement was run.
G8_E E0/E1 are complete and verified with zero validation coverage; E2 remains unopened and awaits owner execution authorization.

**2026-08-16 completion record (supersedes the pre-launch zero-coverage text below):** the external sole-writer runtime `/home/nick/g8_pascal_successor_runtime` contains exactly 3,213 accepted identities, zero available/claimed/request-published/result-published/failed/terminal-invalid states, zero unresolved required ordinals, 3,215 request files and 3,215 result files. Every accepted identity has 5,000 completed trials and binds campaign `g8p-1da44d1fecf684375a0055624abc3c554ecdaf3875b41ee1a13f603f9abe2eca`, profile `confessor_pascal_cu126`, source commit `426110b05161e73e4d819bdc01f4857c012d6d59`, and production-contract SHA-256 `dcb2446d9b7974edb87b00c73691589f5cca49ae50806583097126269e07031b`. The aggregate state SHA-256 is `4e7510e850e59d047b512c1df0e7f5916b4ae6d814505d1bb9e042bc1585655e`; protected counters and `test_access` are zero and `old_result_ingest` is false. The remote audit and final successor verifier both pass; the canonical repository import at `results/baseline/g8_pascal_successor/runtime/` matches the external evidence under normalized tar-stream SHA-256 `dde5a45a2c58320b9b28e13afa459a8cbf2db1614939ad8ff790d42edc27f14b` and passes the same audit/verifier. The 17:30 snapshot's remaining ordinals were 3207, 3209 and 3211; each ended accepted on shard 1 / `cuda:1` / GTX 1080 Ti, attempt 1, complete with 5,000 trials. The coordinator's earlier shard-0 exit code 1 reflected a global in-progress sibling during its final reconciliation, not failed evidence; the later shard-1 reconciliation is complete. The successor-specific C3-C7 closeout now freezes 153 Pascal curves and 3,213 measured points from that runtime; G8_D D0 is authorized but has not started.

<!-- capstone-current-pascal-state: execution=complete; coverage=3213/3213; evidence=published; next=g8-f-f1-running-monitor; bler_table=frozen; g8_d=d7-complete; g8_e_e2e4=complete-verified; g8_e_e5e7=complete-green-pass-one-frozen; readiness_state=f0-v3-green-f1-owner-authorized; runtime_state=f1-external-runtime-authoritative; rerun=forbidden; old_local=immutable-zero-successor-coverage -->

The top-level `results/baseline/g8_pascal_successor/campaign_state.json` is the
immutable zero-coverage readiness marker; the separate
`results/baseline/g8_pascal_successor/runtime/campaign_state.json` is the
completed production state. No G8_C Pascal worker may be started, the old
RTX4060 suffix must not be resumed, predecessor evidence must not be ingested,
and the completed G8_C runtime evidence must not be altered. The separately
authorized G8_F/F1 sole writer is not a G8_C rerun.
The accepted identities represent 16,065,000 intended trials; failed final,
terminal-invalid and unresolved units are zero, as are protected inference,
training, validation-decoding and test-access counters, and
`old_result_ingest` is false.

**Historical 2026-08-15 pre-launch control repair (superseded):** the additive Pascal worker then treated `--max-units` as an attempted-unit cap and stopped that worker's batch after a failed unit; successor-only coordination locks were ignored while requests, results, unit states and `campaign_state.json` remained durable; and `audit_campaign()` cross-checked terminal-invalid ordinals against reconstructed evidence. Contracts and hashes were regenerated. The successor campaign identity and zero-coverage readiness marker were unchanged at that historical point, and no full-strength unit had run.

**Historical 2026-08-15 final pre-launch coordinator repair (superseded):** terminal-accepted ordinals were inspected and skipped without consuming a worker attempt budget; terminal-invalid evidence failed closed; failed/retryable work remained retryable but made both worker and coordinator invocations FAIL/nonzero. Regression coverage proved the fixed-shard progression, failed-unit cap/stop semantics, terminal-invalid hold and final-status signaling. The campaign ID, readiness marker, required grid and frozen PHY were unchanged at that historical 0/3213 state; no real work unit had run then.

**2026-08-16 owner custody decision (AM-86):** the owner-authorized Pascal successor may accumulate immutable authenticated per-unit evidence continuously in its separate mutable runtime on sole writer `confessor`; Git publication may occur after the unattended campaign or at an owner-selected manual checkpoint, and loss before publication is an explicitly accepted custody risk. Surviving evidence is scientifically eligible only through exact campaign/profile/contract authentication and final complete-coverage verification. This exception was used for the completed campaign; complete reconcile/commit/authenticated-HTTPS-push/fetch-parity remains mandatory before BLER-table freeze or G8_D release.

**Execution profiles:** the project now has two independently authenticated
production profiles, `local_4060_cu130` and the qualified
`confessor_pascal_cu126`. A scientific run chooses one before its first
measurement and cannot silently switch. The selected host is the sole writer;
the ordinary publication handoff is verify → reconcile → commit → authenticated
HTTPS push → fetch/parity. AM-86 permits only the Pascal successor to defer Git
publication until its unattended campaign exits or an owner-selected manual
checkpoint, accepting prepublication loss risk while retaining mandatory final
publication/parity. Commit signing is optional prospectively; artifact
hashes/contracts, durable commits, push success and parity remain mandatory at
actual publication. The old local G8_C results
remain valid history but contribute zero successor-table coverage. The Pascal
successor is the only current final G8_C path and `confessor` is its sole writer.
Debate memos: [`audit/pascal-worker-adoption-audit-2026-08-14.md`](audit/pascal-worker-adoption-audit-2026-08-14.md)

**First Review delivery contract — user-fixed; do not ask for it again or reinterpret it.** The maintained checklist is [`deliverables/review-1/first-review-package.md`](deliverables/review-1/first-review-package.md). Completion requires the polished approximately 10–12-slide PPT covering all six rubric categories; ≥25-reference review; corrected Gantt; technical readiness across all four members; G-1 and existing implementation evidence ready for viva; deployment dossier plus the guide's dated acknowledgement of the simulation-first Tier-1/no-required-hardware path; exact corrected H1 wording and 18–22 August dates; the final package under `deliverables/review-1/`; and the annotated `review-1-basis` snapshot cut from that final basis. The backing documents are complete; both 12-slide presentation variants contain an editable, calendar-scaled Gantt. The active deck awaits author review. Future iterations must not front-load AIML buzzwords: slides 1–2 explain the camera, limited noisy link, receiver and classification task; slide 3 explains the conventional path; slide 4 introduces the learned sender/receiver and only then names DJSCC and supervised end-to-end learning. Architecture and loss details belong in methodology. Standard First Review pages must use literal titles so literature, problem/objectives, methodology, hypotheses, feasibility, Gantt, scope/risks and summary are immediately visible. In the Gantt, G8_C and G8_D are complete and G8_E remains pre-data with E2 pending owner authorization; later stages remain planned. Preserve the remaining rules in [`deliverables/review-1/ITERATION-NOTES.md`](deliverables/review-1/ITERATION-NOTES.md), the black-on-white default and prior versions under `deliverables/review-1/fallbacks/`. Final deck approval, four-member rehearsal, guide acknowledgement and snapshot remain.

**Review boundary:** the deck must explicitly map to the six rubric criteria; the literature must synthesize rather than list; the Gantt must show later work as unfinished; and four-member understanding plus the guide response are human facts agents cannot fabricate. Current valid evidence is enough. G8_C completion, a final BLER table, neural training, learned-versus-classical results, demo, thesis chapters, paper, poster, plagiarism report, hardware purchase and SDR implementation are not First Review gates. Do not rerun or weaken science for graphs and do not rewrite provenance. Use the readiness matrix at the end of the package; the prepared guide record remains `PENDING` until the author supplies a real response.

## Single next task

**Next-session task:** inspect, but do not automatically restart or alter, the
exact detached G8_F/F1 sole-writer runtime on `confessor`. Active Pascal F0-v3
and the separate F1-only owner launch are frozen; F0-v1/v2 remain immutable
superseded-before-F1 history and AM-87/AM-88 remain exact. F1 may only
materialize the 50,814 ordered assignments. Do not fine-tune or train any
classifier, perform inference/pass two, invoke fallback, adjudicate a ratio,
access test, rerun any completed campaign, or touch preserved history.

**The current path, stated once. Every live section below must agree with these six lines; if one
does not, it is wrong and this block is right.**

**G8_B is complete and G8_C is green:** the Pascal successor execution is
complete at 3213/3213, exact authority coverage is proven, and the successor
BLER table is frozen from measured points only. The merge report, table and
source/provenance closure are hash-bound under
`results/baseline/g8_pascal_successor/`; the old local campaign remains
immutable superseded history and contributes zero successor-table coverage.
The test split and every later scientific phase remain closed. G8_D D0–D7 are
complete and GREEN; earlier G8_E E1 epochs are immutable superseded-before-data
history, corrected-v3 E1 is frozen pre-data
with zero validation coverage at freeze time, the owner relocated execution to the qualified worker (additive worker-successor epoch, commit `493d656`), production E2 completed at exactly 288000/288000 on `confessor_pascal_cu126`/`cuda:0` with E3 and E4 verified, and the full validation
campaign remains scoped exactly to that authorization.
Everything else stays behind its own gate — do not calibrate λ, train learned
models, implement ER-9, or access the test split until theirs.

⚠️ **It does not begin by constructing a `G8Authorization` and calling `select_operating_points()`.**
That was the previous hand-off's framing and it was wrong, in a way that would have wasted a
session: it implies the only missing piece is permission. The missing piece is the **science**. See
**"What G-8 actually has to build"** below — twelve steps, of which the sweep is step eight.

**Where W4 landed.** `instructions/RESUME.md` is the operational cursor for the four-phase sequence
and wins on progress; every step in all four phases is now `done`. PA recovered and hardened the
post-G-2 state. **PB_1, including its PB_1C correction**, made the classical arm run end to end from
a canonical image to a decoded image plus one of four verdicts (`structural_infeasibility` /
`codec_infeasibility` / `decode_failure` / `delivered`), over the shared AWGN under keyed noise, with
exact bit accounting. **PB_2, including its PB_2C correction**, added the frozen constant-class
outage policy, schema-exact per-image and aggregate records, a crash-resumable bounded runner,
committed bounded evidence and the W4 integration verifier. **PB_3 built the BR-4 selection
machinery and deliberately did not run it** — see the section below. What
remains after W4 is G-8: complete C2, then the full BR-4 validation sweep and
the operating-point decision. The First Review backing artifacts are committed as
`docs/literature-review.md`, `docs/gantt-plan.md`,
`docs/standards-and-tools-register.md`, `docs/deployment-dossier.md` and
`deliverables/review-1/first-review-package.md`. They do not by themselves complete the
user-fixed delivery contract above.

**Three items recorded during B2C, none of them B2C work.** (i) **DJSCC training
infrastructure remains a later W5 task** — it is not part of G-8 and must not be
started to “unblock” anything here. (ii) **The PR-1, PR-2, PR-3 and PR-9
backing documents are complete**; the final deck/export, four-member rehearsal,
guide acknowledgement, final package and snapshot remain due before the
18–22 August First Review window. Finishing W4 did not move the review date. (iii)
**`er1_projected_total_hours_status` remains an open
profiling/governance item** — it is unresolved, it was not touched by B2C, and it still needs a
profiling pass plus a recorded governance decision.

**What PB_3 landed, and what it refused to do.** `src/baseline/classical/composition.py` implements
AM-51's analytic composition — `P(TB success)` as the product over code blocks of `1 - BLER_r`, and
expected accuracy as `P × acc_clean + (1 - P) × acc_outage` — with **both** accuracy terms supplied
as types carrying counts and provenance rather than floats, so AM-58's ban on assuming
`1 / n_classes` is enforced structurally rather than trusted. That matters here specifically because
the committed measurement *is* `100/1000 = 0.1 = 1/10`: the substitution would produce the right
number today and a wrong one the moment the split stopped being exactly stratified.

The BLER lookup is keyed on the **complete** physical-layer identity — the eight fields of
`params.baseline.ldpc_bler_reference_must_match` plus the code rate the committed evidence fixes —
and fails closed in every direction. The committed G-2 evidence characterises exactly one
configuration (`K=128, N=256, BG2, Z=22, rate 1/2, offset-min-sum, offset 0.5, 50 iterations`) at
four SNR points per modulation; anything else returns an explicit `uncharacterized` verdict whose
BLER is `None`, never `0.0`, and an uncharacterized candidate is **ineligible rather than
low-scoring**. Interpolation happens only strictly inside the measured span and only in the
representation `bler_reference.json` declares. Alongside that: a feasibility cache whose key
completeness is asserted at construction, a documented total tie-break order that makes selection
independent of enumeration order, the three system modes (`classical_adaptive`,
`classical_fixed_mod`, `classical_fixed_mcs`) as genuinely different curves, and AM-54's two-pass
maximum enforced by a state machine that also counts the passes a resumed campaign inherited.

**The full-sweep guard is the part to know about before touching any of this.**
`select_operating_points()` refuses more than 64 candidates, 25 samples per cell or a combined 512
cells unless an explicit typed `G8Authorization` is passed. There is no environment variable, no
default-true flag, and **no tracked non-test file in this repository constructs one** — each of
those absences is asserted by a test, not claimed in a comment. Doing the G-8 sweep means
constructing that authorization deliberately, at the gate — but the authorization is the **last**
obstacle, not the first. The sweep is step eight of twelve and steps one to seven do not exist yet;
see "What G-8 actually has to build" below.

`results/baseline/w4/integration_adjudication.json` closes W4 and states, in machine-readable fields
and in prose, that this is bounded validation/plumbing integration, not the BR-4 full validation
sweep, not a G-8 operating-point selection and not test evidence. PB_3 needed **no amendment**: it
implemented and verified existing specification semantics without changing them.

**What PB_3C corrected.** Two defects in the machinery above, plus two process gaps. (1) The
`classical_fixed_mod` curve **searched** for its modulation — it enumerated every modulation in the
grid, summed each one's per-SNR bests and kept the highest total — where BR-9 says
`params.baseline.core_modulation` *defines* that curve. It is now read (`qpsk`), never chosen, and
`held_fixed` records the value and its source. A configured modulation that is undeclared raises; one
with no candidate at a required SNR raises and names the SNR; one whose candidates all turn out
infeasible or uncharacterized is **preserved** as a curve point with `selected = None` and
`reason = no_eligible_candidate`, because that is exactly the cell G-8's completeness preflight has
to be able to refuse. (2) **Resumed campaign state was trusted.** `run_pass()` checked seven
invariants and `_admit_resumed()` checked four, so the crash-recovery path — the one the resumable
design exists for — honoured the weaker contract and would accept pass two with no pass one, a
reversed sequence, a duplicated scorer or a `PassResult` holding objects that are not `Selection`s.
Resumed state must now be an **exact ordered prefix** of `selection_passes()`, validated in the order
supplied and never sorted, with both paths sharing one set of helpers. (3) The tie-break order is
**unchanged** but now frozen before G-8 and fingerprinted as `selection_policy_sha256`. (4) This
hand-off was corrected. PB_3C needed **no amendment** either: it restores BR-9's existing semantics,
and the spec defines no BR-4 selection tie-break to contradict.

**PB_3C provenance correction.** The terminal handoff is `39c43e327573f33011c561c6de22bd05ff93c068`, and its actual subject is `fix: fix push failure due to gpg for resume.md`. The PB_3C implementation/adjudication checkpoint is `08dd358c0f1bd55c70152af900f2932f50d95d19`; PB_3's implementation green is `32edbbb58983e54103b2f252c4d8d8f30aa2378e`; the pre-G8 scientific-measurement green is `3324393a3e1692478bba8cf1020708bf52947f6d`. Do not claim that `39c43e3` has the subject `fix(classical): correct PB_3 selection and resume semantics`.

### Durable G-8 phase partition

The full campaign is frozen under `instructions/G8.txt`: G8_A contract, policy binding, structural enumeration, state and preflight (**complete**); G8_B characterization tooling plus bounded smoke (**complete through B6**); G8_C Pascal successor execution and C3-C7 table closeout (**complete at 3213/3213**); G8_D validation-measurement tooling plus bounded smoke; G8_E full validation measurement and pass one; G8_F training-only artifact corpus, classifier fine-tune and the single pass two; G8_G adjudication. Later phases may not silently reinterpret earlier artifacts.

### What G-8 actually has to build — read this before starting it

The committed G-2 BLER evidence characterises **exactly one** physical-layer identity (`K=128,
N=256, BG2, Z=22, rate 1/2, offset-min-sum 0.5, 50 iterations`) at four SNR points per modulation.
That is a **conformance** artifact. It is **not** the BR-4 characterization table, it remains valid
for G-2, and **it must not be extrapolated or generalised** — the lookup already fails closed
outside it, which is the behaviour to preserve rather than work around.

The Pascal G8_C production transaction, provenance closure and dual-GPU
coordinator are implemented and the owner-authorized execution has completed
at 3213/3213. C3-C7 is now closed by the successor-specific merge report,
measured-only BlerTable and source/provenance closure under
`results/baseline/g8_pascal_successor/`. The predecessor-bound table tools are
not an alternative and contribute zero successor coverage:

1. enumerate the complete **structural candidate/configuration grid** and the code-block identity
   grid;
2. identify every required `(rate, SNR, block identity, modulation)` characterization;
3. run and archive **full-strength BR-4 physical-layer BLER characterization** at the configured
   trial count — **complete for the Pascal successor; no rerun is permitted**;
4. build a separate hash-bound G-8 `BlerTable` artifact and loader — **complete for the Pascal successor**;
5. verify complete coverage **before** selection — **complete for the Pascal successor**;
6. generate cached codec reconstructions and measured clean-classifier accuracies on validation;
7. construct measured codec-accuracy objects from verified artifacts, never from manual counts;
8. execute pass one;
9. build the training-only artifact corpus;
10. fine-tune the artifact classifier;
11. execute pass two, once;
12. adjudicate the operating ratios and the other G-8 outputs.

**Two words are load-bearing.** It is a *structural* candidate grid, not a "feasible" one: codec
feasibility is not known until the codec-search artifacts have been produced, whereas structural
transport identities can be enumerated up front. And it is *physical-layer* BLER characterization,
not "validation" BLER: BLER is a channel-simulation artifact. Reserve "validation" for
codec/classifier records derived from the validation split.

**G-8's outputs are:** `efficiency_ratio`; `crossover_ratio`; `low_ratio_operating_point`; classical
non-degeneracy; the one-ratio-versus-two-ratio full-strength ER-1 decision; the artifact-finetuned
classifier release; the final pass-two classical selections; and the frozen H2 validation window.

⚠️ **G-8 selects the parameter named `crossover_ratio` using ER-3's learned-blind classical rule. It
does not decide whether a learned-versus-classical curve crossover actually exists; that decision
remains at G-10, after learned models exist.** The name is a trap for a reader who has not been told
this.

**The campaign-opening manifest must bind three things, and the runner must refuse to resume or
adjudicate if any of them differs:** the SHA-256 of
`results/baseline/w4/integration_adjudication.json`; the `selection_policy_sha256` recorded inside it
(currently `6a4ffa98a26ee627f8339f1668f11305e097ca813e246d46a235dbfb2476db0e`); and the PB_3C green
commit or the resolved selection-source identities. That binding is what makes the preregistration
machine-enforceable rather than merely historically visible. **Changing the tie-break order after the
sweep starts invalidates the campaign** — there is no partial-credit path, because a ranking rule
chosen after seeing the table is not a preregistered rule.

**As of the G8_C closeout:** no real G-8 operating-point authorization exists anywhere in tracked
non-test code; no ratio has been selected; no classifier has been fine-tuned; no later validation
measurement has run; the test split is sealed until G-12 at W11; G8_D D0 is the next authorized
gate but has not started; and PR-1, PR-2 and PR-9 remain outstanding.

**What PB_2 landed.** The outage class is selected by counting labels across the *entire* committed
Imagenette-160 validation manifest: the split is exactly stratified, so all ten classes tie at 100
of 1000 and the configured lowest-index tie-break picks **class 0**, measured accuracy **100/1000 =
0.1**. That equals `1/n_classes`, which is exactly why nothing here compares the float — the
artifact records numerator, denominator and the full count vector, and the verifier re-derives them
from the manifest. Records conform exactly to `params.artifacts.csv_schema` (52 fields) and
`params.artifacts.per_image_schema` (16 fields), read at runtime; the system value is
`classical_fixed_mcs`, because PB_2 fixes one configuration and builds no adaptation. Bounded
evidence (as regenerated by PB_2C): 55 rows in 50.0 s — 5 CIFAR-10 transport-only samples with **no classifier inference and
no task score at all** (the frozen checkpoint is an Imagenette-160 model, and ten equal output
indices are not a shared class vocabulary), plus 24 Imagenette-160 validation images at 18 dB
(24/24 delivered, top1 18/24) and −8 dB (24/24 real decode failures, top1 3/24 via the frozen outage
class), plus structural- and codec-infeasibility fixtures. **None of those accuracies is an
experimental result.** The `header_bytes`/`payload_bytes` reading that PB_2 flagged rather than
asserted is now settled normatively by AM-81; see the two "Settled" sections below.

**What PB_2C corrected.** A fresh audit found eight defects that the first W4 verifier could not
see, because it checked consistency *between committed artifacts* rather than whether each artifact
described the cell it claimed to describe. The runner resolved **one** configuration at 18 dB and
reused its hash for the −8 dB cell, the CIFAR-10 rows and both fixtures — and modulation, LDPC rate
and encode axis were not in the fingerprint at all. Infeasible rows recorded a null `noise_id` and
built `pair_id` from it, so they could never pair with a transmitting comparison arm. The BR-11 byte
columns were averaged over delivered rows only, so an all-decode-failure cell reported no overhead.
`Psot` was read six bytes early (it happened to land correctly on these small codestreams, via the
`Psot = 0` fallback, but would mis-split a multi-tile-part one). The row timer excluded classifier
inference; the summary wall clock ignored pre-resume rows; and the OpenJPEG preflight ran after the
results directory existed. **Every scientific outcome survived the repair unchanged** — the numbers
that moved are the decode-failure overhead (blank → 157.0 / 892.54 bytes), the per-cell config
hashes, the run IDs that follow them, and the now-complete timings. Details:
`worklogs/w4-classical-baseline-progress.md`; ledger: `instructions/RESUME.md`.

**What PB_1C corrected.** An external audit flagged, and independent inspection of the installed
Sionna 2.0.1 source confirmed, that the TS 38.212 §5.4.2.2 modulation bit interleaver was being
applied **twice** on the transmit path and undone twice on the receive path. Sionna owns it — the
adapter builds `LDPC5GEncoder` with `num_bits_per_symbol=q_m`, so the encoder permutes after rate
matching and the paired decoder inverts before rate recovery — and `channel_transport.modulate()`
applied the same permutation again. QPSK and 16-QAM transmitted the permutation *squared*; BPSK was
unaffected (Qm = 1 is the identity). PB_1's round-trip tests could not catch it: the paired errors
cancel, so CRC passed, the codestream returned byte-exact, and every count identity held. The repair
lives entirely in `src/baseline/classical/`, touched **no** `src/baseline/ldpc/` file, and needed no
spec amendment — it restores behaviour the spec already required. Bit accounting, emitted bytes and
codestream hashes are unchanged; only 16-QAM realised symbol energy and PAPR moved, as expected.
Details: `worklogs/w4-classical-baseline-progress.md`; ledger: `instructions/RESUME.md`.

### Settled — `j2k_resolutions` vs CIFAR-10's small axes (AM-80)

**Decided. Do not reopen.** `params.baseline.downsample_axis_px.cifar10` is now `[32]`: the 24 px
and 16 px rungs are gone. `params.baseline.j2k_resolutions = 6` requires every tile dimension to be
at least `2^5 = 32` px, so OpenJPEG hard-errored at those two rungs for *every* image and *every*
budget — they were invalid codec configurations, not low-rate candidates. The rejected alternative
was making `j2k_resolutions` axis-dependent or clamped to `min(6, floor(log2(axis)) + 1)`; that
would have added a new codec rule and more cache-identity complexity without helping either
headline dataset, and CIFAR-10 is a DEC-1 plumbing smoke path whose 32 px rung works.

The consequence was known and accepted: `downsample_axis_px` participates in the content-addressed
codec configuration hash, so **every J2K cache key changed**. The one completed campaign this
touches is the transparency-bitrate probe, which encoded Imagenette-160 exclusively and therefore
cannot have depended on a CIFAR-10 rung. **AM-82** binds that probe's codec configuration as
history and permits the difference only through a single byte-pinned off-measurement-path record
(`results/probes/transparency_bitrate/codec_configuration_readjudication.json`) that names the
superseded and current hashes and the exact parameter that moved. It is not a drift allowlist: any
further codec drift, any change to an Imagenette axis or a shared J2K setting, or a failed
reachability check fails the verifier. The probe was **not** re-run.

The pipeline now rejects 24 px and 16 px as *unconfigured* before the codec runs. Reproduction of
the resolved state, including a direct codec call proving the rungs were removed for a real
constraint rather than for tidiness:
`tests/test_classical_pipeline.py::test_j2k_resolutions_cannot_encode_cifar10s_small_axes`.

### Settled — BR-11 `header_bytes` / `payload_bytes` (AM-81)

**Decided. Do not reopen.** `bytes_sent = source_bytes = A/8`. `header_bytes` is *all* structural
codestream bytes (SOC, every main-header marker segment, every SOT marker segment, every tile-part
header through and including SOD, EOC, and each tile-part's equivalent structural bytes);
`payload_bytes` is *all* tile-part data bytes after SOD and before the next tile-part boundary —
**not** "entropy-coded sample data", because that region may also carry packet headers.
`emitted_codestream_bytes = header_bytes + payload_bytes`, and
`payload_filler_bytes = bytes_sent − emitted_codestream_bytes` is reported separately, never folded
into either column. Both columns are means over **every row that emitted a codestream** — delivered
*and* decode-failure — and are null only when no codestream was emitted at all. The old
delivered-only denominator meant an all-decode-failure cell reported no overhead, which is exactly
the regime BR-11 exists to expose. `params.config.analysis_version` is bumped to **2** because
redefining an aggregate column's meaning and denominator is an analysis-implementation change.

`tools/check_doc_consistency.py` mechanically enforces that this block is not contradicted
elsewhere in this file: a live section may not prohibit the declared next task, may not direct
already-completed work as the next step, and the live sections named in the check must each mention
the declared frontier. Historical content is exempt only where it sits behind a struck-through
heading, a `**DONE**`/`**Complete**`/`PASS` marker, or the `## Session log`. Rewriting the phase in
that block without rewriting the sections that quote it now fails the preflight rather than
surviving three sessions.

W3 implementation is frozen at
`968e907237bbe571adf6ec48e4711ea021831719`. The committed G-2 evidence under
`results/baseline/g2/` binds that clean commit and passes golden vectors, the project-owned offline
fixture, mapper/demapper/interleaver and CRC known answers, independent BLER-reference provenance,
all three waterfall comparisons, 216-cell runtime packetisation, the frozen-but-unrun progressive
packet design, commit cleanliness and the test seal.

Measured waterfall displacements at BLER `1e-2` are BPSK `0.0 dB`, QPSK
`+0.0036302378989723216 dB`, and 16-QAM `0.0 dB`, all within the `0.5 dB` gate. The G-2 campaign
used 5,000 blocks at each of four points per modulation, K=128, N=256, BG2, Z=22, rate 1/2,
flooding offset-min-sum with offset 0.5 and 50 iterations. No image path, model training or test
access ran.

### Completed and remotely published before W3

fix `d82e5354dd1dc66461333ea2b16a47957f158ca0`. Remote `main` was verified at `d82e5354…` before
W3 began. The probe rerun had zero scientific drift: clean `898/1000`, 68,000 cells, zero
infeasible encodes, zero decode failures, and byte-identical per-image/aggregate outputs.

The reference-classifier integrity implementation is committed as
`89a3af48c48a91d6d272ba62337f890c59bb40a5`. The full clean Imagenette-160 campaign then ran
fresh from epoch zero through epoch 99 on the configured RTX 4060 Laptop GPU path. It achieved
**898/1000 = 0.898 validation top-1**, best and final at epoch 99, clearing the preregistered 0.88
floor without a fallback rung.

orders, checkpoint/config identities, optimizer/scheduler state and full-lineage fields, then
exercised the transactional full-mode resume validator. The complete preflight suite was 250 passed;
all wider G-1 checks passed. Test remained sealed: ordinary test loading is rejected, the guarded
module is structurally isolated, full mode constructs only train/validation views, and the
instrumented published-test provenance scans made zero decoder and canonicalization calls. There was
therefore zero model-facing test loading, inference or accuracy computation.

The four tracked aggregate outputs plus `results/reference_classifier/g1_adjudication.json` hold the
portable evidence. The final checkpoint path is
`checkpoints/reference_classifier/epoch-99.pt`; it is preserved as the sole asset of GitHub Release
`g1-reference-classifier-2026-07-29`, named
`reference-classifier-imagenette160-epoch99-9c37362347a0203597d6e8e9d9a58fde.pt`. The other 99
ignored checkpoints were not uploaded, and no training was rerun. Verify the record offline with
`.venv/bin/python tools/verify_g1_adjudication.py`. See
`worklogs/w1-reference-classifier-progress.md` for the full adjudication.

**Current engineering order:**

1. ~~Evidence-hardening cleanup.~~ **Complete.**
2. ~~**W2 implementation through G-7.**~~ **Complete — G-7 PASS.**
3. ~~**Transparency-bitrate probe using the frozen reference classifier.**~~ **Complete.**
4. ~~**W3: LDPC fixture/integration, BER/BLER validation, and complete packetisation/bit accounting
   through G-2.**~~ **Complete — G-2 PASS.**
5. ~~**W4 PA — recover and harden post-G-2 state.**~~ **Complete.**
6. ~~**W4 PB_1, including the PB_1C correction — the classical transport path.**~~ **Complete.**
7. ~~**W4 PB_2, including the PB_2C correction — outage policy, records and bounded evidence.**~~
   **Complete.**
8. ~~**W4 PB_3 — BR-4 selection infrastructure and the W4 adjudication.**~~ **Complete.**
9. **G-8 classical validation work — Pascal successor execution complete at
   3213/3213.** G8_A and G8_B are complete; the successor adapter and final
   verifier pass, while C5 table freeze and later validation/selection phases
   remain gated until the repository supplies the successor-specific closeout.
   See `instructions/RESUME.md` for the historical C3–C7 contract; do not use
   its predecessor-bound commands on the Pascal runtime.

W2's implementation commit is `26b631ede27a6f88f1d004a66b845c52a658e07c`. The clean G-7
corrected implementation-bound profile completed all 8,469 Imagenette training images at batch 32
in 48.684 s, with 1.004 GiB peak reserved VRAM, a 1.352 h 100-epoch projection and 1,640,957
parameters. Every critical runtime module is byte- and blob-bound to the clean detached W2
implementation worktree. The subsequent validation-only JPEG 2000 probe loaded the exact frozen
G-1 checkpoint, reproduced 898/1000 clean, and completed all 68,000 fixed budget/axis/sample cells.
OpenJPEG 2.5.4 through Glymur 0.14.3 produced zero infeasible cells and zero decode failures. The
selection-aware paired bootstrap forecasts the 5 pp threshold at 1,330 bytes (axis 128, mean
0.408654 bpp, 0.870 accuracy, LCB −0.041) and the 2 pp threshold at 3,200 bytes (axis 160, mean
0.987788 bpp, 0.886 accuracy, LCB −0.018); neither is censored. These are probe forecasts only:
G-8 remains unresolved. No training ran and the test split stayed sealed. **Those forecasts are not
a substitute for the sweep**: a G-8 operating point must come out of the BR-4 validation sweep run
through the PB_3 selection machinery, never out of the probe's bootstrap. The reference-classifier
fallback ladder stays closed.

## Just landed — the Codex gate audit adjudicated, AM-57..AM-64 applied

**`audit/JUDGE_codex` (`EXT-6`)** returned **project GO, W1 NOGO — temporary hold**: 11 P0 findings,
10 P1s, 3 P2s. It is the most accurate review this project has received. **Every checkable numeric
claim reproduced exactly** when re-derived — the packetisation defect counts, the corrected canonical
case, the grid arithmetic, the runtime figures, and an H4 power calculation no earlier review
attempted. Verified independently rather than adopted: the packetisation against a separately written
solver, the base-graph rate floor and the modulation interleaver against the **pinned Sionna source**
rather than its docs, the review dates by rendering a scanned PDF that has no extractable text, and
the torchvision loader against current upstream docs.

**Exactly one claim was rejected, and one sharpened:**
- **Rejected — "`run_id` cannot pair systems".** It is a structured tuple key; pairing on every field
  except `system` is well defined. The *real* defect is the opposite: the key omitted `split`, the
  config and checkpoint hashes, the classifier variant and every system-specific setting, so distinct
  runs **collided** — validation with test, and the two BR-12 classifier variants with each other.
- **Sharpened — the ER-1 projection.** The audit was right that a 21/18 rescaling is not arithmetic,
  but the direction is the reverse of the obvious guess: the added points are at the **noisy** end
  where BR-4 picks BPSK, whose channel-bit budget is a quarter of 16-QAM's and which needs 2 code
  blocks rather than 11. The worst-case figure **overstates** there. Both ends are now recorded.

**Three decisions you made this session, don't reopen:** H3 keeps the **full-grid** slope and gains a
magnitude-contraction clause (the audit's high-SNR refit was rejected — it abandons the half of the
grid where the effect is largest); W10's rehearsal and the Second Review figure move to
**validation**, test stays sealed behind a freeze manifest until **G-12 at W11** (AM-60 — it briefly
read G-10, which after AM-59 sits at the *start of W9* and would have released the split three weeks
early); H4's power floor is declared and simulated **before the test split opens at G-12** rather
than fixed by more training runs (AM-70 — ER-9 does not exist until W9).

**The packetisation script reported zero failures while breaking four of its own rules** — that is
the finding worth carrying forward. 92/215 rows had a non-byte-aligned `A` under a solver whose own
parameter promises byte alignment; 21 had a non-integral `B'/C` silently rescued with `ceil`; 47/103
BG2 rows computed filler from the selection `K_b` instead of the encoded `K = 10Z`; and the rate
floor was tested *strictly* against the **smallest** `E_r` — the block least likely to fail — when the
library raises only on `r < floor` and BG1's mother code is exactly 1/3. Fixing all four keeps 215
configs feasible and **every** headline-dataset config feasible, moves capacity in 18 rows by −8 to
+1 byte, and cuts the clamps from **six to three**. Canonical case is now **A = 42,624 b (5,328 B),
B' = 42,792, K' = 7,132, Z = 352, filler 612/block and 3,672 total**. A repair, not a collapse.

**The proof obligation is now all 144 headline-dataset configs, not the 72 that today's three
provisional ratios name** — ER-3 can select any rung, so the old scope proved nothing about the
configuration actually used. That change immediately found something: **ER-9's admissible (dim, bits)
pairs fall to 1 at STL-10's `r_1_48`**, so at the ladder bottom its "two-stage validation search" has
one candidate. Recorded as a carried risk; G-11 must report the count.

**The circular was readable all along.** It is scanned images with no extractable text — which is not
the same as unreadable. Rendering its two pages resolves all four dates: First Review **18–22 Aug
(W4)**, Second **29 Sep–3 Oct (W10)**, Final **17–21 Nov (W17, not the W16 the spec carried)**, report
due **20 Nov — inside Final Review week**. W16 is now deliberately allocated contingency and W15
carries an internal freeze. Clause 5 also expects hardware or "significant design aspects with an
application to real world problems", so PR-9 is a full deployment dossier and the guide must be asked
before W4. ~~⚠️ **The repo's proposal DOCX is a blank template — PR-10 exists because registration
status is unverified.**~~ **Registration confirmed complete 2026-07-28 (AM-63)** — the blank
attachment proved nothing either way, which is why it was checked rather than assumed. That was the
only carried risk with no graceful degradation; PR-10 is closed.

## Previously — two external reviews adjudicated, 30 amendments applied, committed as `8e65329`

**Two independent full-spec reviews** (`EXT-4`, Claude; `EXT-5`, a second model) were adjudicated
against the spec and the W0 evidence, not deferred to. **Neither verdict was adopted as given.**
EXT-4 said "commit after seven edits" but its one external claim was false and it missed the three
worst defects; EXT-5 said "NO-GO/HOLD on the whole spec" but only *one* of its findings touched W1.
Result: 122 → **158 requirements**, `AM-26`..`AM-55`, split into two rounds in §17. A third round
followed on 2026-07-28 — `AM-56`, from a **self-audit of those two rounds**, which found that AM-53
had left H2 able to select its comparison window on a different curve from the one it evaluates.
That round closed at 159 requirements; the count is **172** after AM-57..AM-64 above. Worth noting as
a pattern rather than an embarrassment: every audit round so far — including the audit of the audit,
and including the round that audited a *passing* evidence script — has found something real.

**The three that mattered, all confirmed by recomputation, none of which either review found alone:**

1. **ER-9 was arithmetically impossible** (AM-55). Sharing `transmit_feature_dim` pinned it at 2k
   real values while the digital budget gives `Qm·R/2` bits per value — **0.167 at BPSK 1/3**
   against a 2-bit floor. Every config except 16-QAM 5/6 was infeasible, and that one only decodes
   above ~11 dB, *outside H1's region entirely*. So the H4 control would have sat at chance across
   exactly the range it is tested in — unfalsifiable, and flattering. Same class as AM-15.
   **Fixed:** ER-9 keeps the identical encoder and chooses its own `transmit_dim` on validation.
2. **TS 38.212 packetisation was non-conformant three ways** (AM-49): CRC24A applied
   unconditionally where 17 of 72 live configs are entitled to CRC16; `code_block_max_bits` 8448
   applied where 14 select BG2 (3840); and the base graph derived *after* segmentation from the
   per-CB rate, where the standard selects it once per TB from (A,R) *before*. **Blast radius is
   small** — segmentation changes in zero configs, so BR-3 and BR-10's zero-slack result survive and
   the cost is one byte in 17 cells. It is a defect in DEC-13's *claim*, not in any number.
3. **ER-10 promised a variance decomposition AM-17 had already made impossible** (AM-31) — zipped
   seeds alias training luck and channel luck. Now compound replicates.

Plus **G-8 was required to decide a crossover it cannot observe** (AM-33) — W6's sweep is
classical-only and no learned model exists until W7. New **G-10** decides it — placed at W10 then,
moved to the **start of W9** by AM-59.

**Three decisions you made this session, don't reopen:** ER-9 gets the *same encoder with its own
output width* (not a bolted-on layer, not fixed pooling); seeds are *compound replicates* (don't pay
3× ER-1 to restore the decomposition); BR-4 selection is *two passes then stop*.

**What was rejected, with reasons, so it doesn't come back:**
- **EXT-4's OCUDU claim is false** (AM-30). It said the successor ships the same vectors under
  BSD-3, so the archived-upstream risk could be closed. OCUDU publishes **no pre-generated vectors** —
  they moved to a MATLAB-companion plugin whose docs require a licensed MATLAB + 5G Toolbox. The
  risk is *worse* than recorded, and §16's old mitigation line ("take them from OCUDU") was also
  wrong and is deleted. ⚠️ **Action: the pinned srsRAN asset is still live (verified HTTP 200) —
  fetch and archive it locally, outside git, before W3.**
- **H1's run rule stays** (AM-32) — but AM-4's *bound* was wrong, and that is now recorded. Positive
  dependence does **not** sandwich the answer: four independent blocks of three, each all-or-nothing
  Bernoulli(0.025), gives ≈0.096, four times the "perfect dependence" figure. The conclusion holds
  under AR-1/exchangeable dependence, so ER-10 now *measures* it by sign-flip permutation instead of
  arguing it. EXT-5's proposed replacement already exists as `h1_effect_size` (AM-3).
- **BR-13's random outage draw stays** — it is reproducible from `channel_seed` and therefore
  identical across systems, which is what ER-10's pairing needs. Only its *reporting* changed.
- **EXT-4's rubric denominator was wrong**: Third Review is **60** sub-marks, not 55. Its
  conclusions still hold — `Objectives Met` really is 10, and PR-8 now forbids stating objectives as
  outcomes (AM-46).

**New evidence artifact:** [`spec/evidence/check_packetisation.py`](spec/evidence/check_packetisation.py)
— pure arithmetic, no GPU/network, runs in under a second, emits the per-config record BR-10 now
requires. Confirms zero slack across 215 feasible configs, **the same six BG1 clamps** (so AM-24
stands), BR-10's canonical case exact, and **ER-9 feasible at all 72 live configs** (7 options even
at the tightest, 94 bytes).

## In flight — nothing

**G-9 is closed. The LDPC spike passed all seven checks** (AM-24, AM-25). The environment lives in
`~/capstone-w0-spike/` and is reusable: `./run_spike.sh run` re-runs in seconds and regenerates
`g9_spike_record.json`. Python 3.14.6 · torch 2.13.0+cu130 · sionna-no-rt 2.0.1 · RTX 4060 Laptop 8 GB.

**Measured, now in the spec:** exact `E_r` across **all 180 configurations** (72 live), so BR-3 holds
against the library and not just on paper · 625.2 code-block decodes/s at 50 iterations, batch 32
(corrected from 634 by AM-29 — the old figure was faster than the committed evidence) ·
ER-1 projects to **~2.0 h at one ratio, ~4.1 h at two**, worst-case modulation — so **G-8's
one-ratio-or-two decision is not compute-constrained**, which was the open question AM-20 deferred ·
smallest workable payload 16 bits.

**Three defects the spike caught, which is what it was for:**

1. **LLR sign.** The library reads LLRs as log(p(x=1)/p(x=0)) — the *opposite* sign to `x = 1−2c`.
   Getting it backwards is **totally silent**: decoder runs, returns exactly k bits, raises nothing,
   BER 0.77 where the correct sign gives 0.00. At W3 this would have looked like "the classical
   baseline is weak" — i.e. it would have manufactured the result ER-8 forbids. Fixed at the BR-14
   seam as `params.baseline.ldpc_llr_convention`.
2. **Rate 1/3 did not exist at three live operating points.** `floor(G × rate)` lands at 0.333281
   against BG1's floor of 0.333333, and BG1 cannot go lower without repetition coding. One-bit clamp,
   applied *after* segmentation. In BR-10 as `params.baseline.ldpc_bg1_min_coderate`.
3. **Spelling.** Spec says `offset_min_sum`; the library only accepts `offset-minsum`. Mapped at the
   seam.

**Golden vectors — solved, and better than expected.** Sionna now agrees **bit-exactly with the
MATLAB-generated srsRAN vectors, zero mismatches**, across lifting sizes 2–288 on both base graphs.
BR-2 is no longer a plan, it is a demonstrated result. The alignment recipe is in BR-2 and is not
obvious — three wrong attempts agreed at 0.50, which is chance and looks exactly like a library bug.

**Evidence is now in the repo: [`spec/evidence/`](spec/evidence/).** The spike record, the scripts
that produced it, the golden-vector check and its log, and the fetch script plus checksums. Read its
`README.md` first. Two things it deliberately does *not* contain: the third-party `.dat` vectors and
srsRAN's `ldpc_encoder_test_data.h`, both AGPLv3 and both `.gitignore`d — run
`spec/evidence/fetch_srsran_vectors.sh` to obtain them. Note the README's variance caveat: re-running
the spike gives 625–663 cb/s, and the spec records the figure from the **committed run** (625.2)
because ER-7 requires every number to resolve to an artifact in the repo — it previously read 634,
which was faster than the evidence beside it (AM-29). The old scratch copies at `~/capstone-w0-spike/` are now redundant.

## Do next

### ⏰ First Review delivery contract (check this every session)

The readiness trigger (`PR-1` committed · `PR-2` committed · `G-1` passed) has fired. It authorises package preparation; it does not mean the package is complete. The user-fixed acceptance checklist is [`deliverables/review-1/first-review-package.md`](deliverables/review-1/first-review-package.md) and MUST NOT be re-elicited from the user.

Remaining delivery work:

1. produce and polish the approximately 10–12-slide deck covering Motivation, Objectives, Hypothesis, Problem Survey, Subject Knowledge and Time Plan;
2. rehearse until all four members can independently explain the architecture, methodology, fairness controls, data isolation, exact H1 rule, evidence boundaries and current implementation state;
3. obtain and record the guide's dated acknowledgement of the simulation-first Tier-1/no-required-hardware path;
4. place the editable deck, PDF and supporting package under `deliverables/review-1/`; and
5. only then cut the annotated `review-1-basis` tag from that final review basis.

The supporting ≥25-reference literature review, corrected Gantt, standards/tools register, deployment dossier and viva evidence map are already available. The First Review window is **18–22 August 2026**, not the obsolete 22–26 August dates from the 2023 rubric sheet.

The objectives slide MUST use §2's **completion** terms — build, validate, bandwidth-match, bit-account, evaluate at the learned-blind operating point, and report with paired inference — never an outcome promise such as “show the learned system beats the classical one.” H1 MUST use the repaired decision rule: a point qualifies when the studentized paired mean exceeds 1.96; support requires both `R_obs ≥ 3` consecutive qualifying points at or below the training SNR and calibrated run p-value ≤ 0.05. A crossing is not required.

The slot is **15 minutes**. The rubric scores six criteria × 5 sub-marks = 30, scaled to 10. `Presentation` is not itself a First Review criterion, but the user requires a polished deck and all four members ready for the viva.

### Cold-start: the first thing to do in a fresh session

**W1, W2, W3 and W4 are complete, as are G-1, G-2, G-7 and the validation-only
transparency-bitrate probe.** Do not reopen the reference-classifier recipe, start its fallback
ladder, implement the G-7 width fallback, select an operating point from the probe's forecasts, or
open another full-spec audit round without new evidence. **The owner-opened Pascal successor has
completed its full 3213/3213 authenticated production campaign and G8_C C3-C7 closeout.** Its
153-curve successor table is frozen from measured points only; the predecessor-bound table tools
cannot be substituted. `src/baseline/classical/composition.py` remains later selection machinery;
G8_D D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6 and D7 are complete and GREEN; corrected-v3 G8_E E1 is frozen pre-data with zero validation coverage, the owner E2–E4 authorization was issued for the worker successor (commit `493d656`), and production E2 completed at exactly 288000/288000 on `confessor` with E3 exact-set closure and E4 measured accuracy objects verified; do not
rerun it or widen its scope — E5/pass one awaits a separate owner authorization. The historical C3–C7 contract remains in
`instructions/RESUME.md`; its predecessor commands do not apply to the Pascal runtime. The
committed G-2 table covers one physical-layer identity at four SNR points per modulation and must
not be extrapolated. Read "What G-8 actually has to build" above before starting, and
`instructions/RESUME.md` for the facts that work needs. The sweep entry point remains separately
authorization-gated, and no `G8Authorization` exists in this repository.
Registration remains confirmed (AM-63). PR-9's author-owned hardware-alternative acknowledgement
does not gate G8, but it is required to complete the user-fixed First Review package.

**State on 2026-07-29, verified:** the W1 implementation culminates in `89a3af4`; G-1 evidence was
produced from that exact clean commit. `results/reference_classifier/` holds the four original
aggregate artifacts plus the machine-readable adjudication. `checkpoints/reference_classifier/`
holds 100 ignored checkpoints from epoch 0 through 99, but only the portable epoch-99 path was
preserved in the named GitHub Release. The best/final validation result is 898/1000 = 0.898 at epoch
99.
`.venv` holds the locked runtime stack. Machine: Python 3.14.6 · `uv` 0.11.32 at `/usr/sbin/uv` ·
RTX 4060 Laptop 8 GB · driver 592.82 · Torch CUDA 13.0. The three dataset archives/extractions and
srsRAN vectors remain locally available and ignored as designed.

Confirm nothing drifted before starting the G-8 work:

```

**The fetch line is not optional on a fresh clone.** `tests/fixtures/ldpc_ts38212_golden.npz` is
git-ignored by design (AM-25 — third-party vector bytes are never committed, only their checksums and
a fetcher), and the srsRAN fixture test hard-asserts the file rather than skipping, so an
unmaterialized clone fails `pytest` for a provenance reason that looks like a scientific one. The
fetch is a network-free no-op once the fixture exists.

#### GPU access — probe it, do not assume it either way

This is **WSL2**, so the GPU arrives through `/dev/dxg` and a Microsoft-supplied driver shim, not
through `/dev/nvidia*`. An agent that checks for the wrong device concludes there is no GPU on a
machine that has one. Run all three and report them verbatim:

```bash
ls -l /dev/dxg                                      # the WSL GPU device
/usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,driver_version --format=csv,noheader
.venv/bin/python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda, torch.cuda.is_available(), \
    torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).name if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'NONE')"
```

**Measured 2026-07-28:** `/dev/dxg` present as `crw-rw-rw- root 10,125`; the WSL `nvidia-smi` reports
`NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, 592.82`; torch reports `13.0 True`, and a real device matmul
succeeds. **The first two also succeed inside the Codex sandbox**, which earlier failed NVML — so
that restriction has lifted, at least for the device node.

**The third command is the only one that settles it.** A visible `/dev/dxg` and a working
`nvidia-smi` do **not** guarantee torch can initialise CUDA; that additionally needs `libcuda`
resolvable through the WSL shim. Report `torch.cuda.is_available()` explicitly rather than inferring
it from the other two. Two notes: the plain `nvidia-smi` on `PATH` and the one at
`/usr/lib/wsl/lib/` are **not always the same binary**, so prefer the explicit path; and
`nvidia-smi` says `CUDA Version: 13.1` while torch is built for `13.0` — **normal minor-version
compatibility, not a mismatch, and not a reason to move the pin.**

If CUDA device access is unavailable while the pinned CUDA build remains installed, the two
device-dependent tests are expected to fail; all other tests must pass. The two are
`test_cuda_is_available` and `test_environment_record_is_fully_populated`, and they **must not be
skipped, weakened, or given a skip marker** — that is the AM-23 alarm working, and an escape hatch
would disarm the only check that catches a CPU build on the machine that trains.

Network is a **separate** permission from device access. The AM-77 fetch completed from all three
normative URLs; a clean checkout still needs access for `tools/fetch_datasets.py` because archives
and extractions are deliberately ignored. If the configured URLs are blocked in a sandbox, request
unsandboxed network access rather than substituting mirrors. Once provisioned, manifest checks,
dataset verification and classifier training use the local verified data.

`check_doc_consistency.py` is new (AM-62) and exists because the same propagation failure happened
three rounds running. It enforces the convention this repo already had — **a superseded value may
appear only in a block that cites the amendment which superseded it** — across the hand-written files
that `--check` never looked at. When an amendment supersedes a value that appears in prose, add a
rule to its `stale` table; that table is the tool's memory and is meant to grow.

#### ~~Batch 1 — scaffold + environment (W1a)~~ **DONE 2026-07-28.** What it cost, and what it taught

Landed: `requirements.in`/`requirements.lock`, `requirements-cpu.in`/`requirements-cpu.lock`,
`pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore` entries, `src/config/params.py`, `src/env.py`, `tests/test_env.py`,
`tests/test_doc_consistency.py`, and AM-65..AM-67. The assertion passes on the RTX 4060:
torch 2.13.0+cu130, CUDA 13.0, `torch.cuda.is_available()` True.

**Three findings, all from running the commands rather than reading about them (AM-65..AM-67).**
The hand-off called the cu130 *extra index* "the one real unknown"; it was the smaller half of the
problem, and the resolve was fine once `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` was passed.

1. **`uv pip sync` would have uninstalled PyYAML and broken all three spec checks.** `sync` makes the
   environment *exactly* the lockfile — anything absent is removed, not left alone — and the batch as
   originally scoped had a runtime-only `requirements.in`. Fixed by making the lock a **superset**
   that pins PyYAML (AM-65). Caught by reading what `sync` does; it would have fired on the first
   command of W1 and stayed silent until the next spec edit.
2. **`--emit-index-url` is not optional, and this one did fire.** A lockfile compiled without it
   records **no index at all**, so nothing can install it — not `uv`, and not the plain
   `pip install --require-hashes` that SR-21's portability clause requires, which means that clause
   was untestable as written. The error names only the version (`no version of torch==2.13.0+cu130`)
   and never mentions the missing index, so it reads exactly like a bad pin (AM-66).
3. **The CPU-only lock is built** rather than promised (AM-67).

**Two operational notes for anyone re-running the install.** `pypi.nvidia.com` timed out twice under
uv's default concurrency on wheels in the 200–350 MB range; `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=900
UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=2` got it through, and the cache persists so retries resume rather than
restart. And **do not pipe the install through `tail`** — `$?` then reports the pipe's status and a
failed sync looks like a success.

#### ~~Batch 2 — config plumbing + literal lint~~ **DONE 2026-07-28, committed as `2b23c1e`**

The point-in-time plan is [`docs/plans/w1-batch2.md`](docs/plans/w1-batch2.md). Batch 2 added the
resolved frozen `RunConfig`, canonical SHA-256 config hashing, two committed experiment-choice YAML
files, and `tools/check_literals.py` with mutation tests for positive and negative literals and
reasoned exceptions. AM-68..AM-70 take the spec to 178 requirements.

Three things settled with the author and recorded there:
run configs are **committed experiment files naming choices only**, with sweep axes and the resolved
per-run config archived beside results (one file per run would be thousands of unreviewable files);
the literal lint **hard-fails with per-site `# literal-ok: <reason>` annotations** that must carry a
reason and are counted in the summary; and the plan lives in the repo rather than inline here.

**The finding from planning that batch 3 depended on is closed by AM-69:** `dataset_version` and
`analysis_version`, previously undefined, now resolve through `params.config`; `config_hash` and
`checkpoint_id` remain runtime-computed by design and were never gaps.

#### ~~Batch 3 — identity, keyed RNG, test guard~~ **DONE 2026-07-28** (SR-18, SR-22)

`src/artifacts/ids.py`, `src/artifacts/rng.py` and `src/data/test_access.py` — the two things that
could not be retrofitted. **No amendment was needed**, which is itself the signal that AM-69 had
already closed the gap this batch would otherwise have hit. 54 tests pass.

Verified by re-derivation rather than by reading the diff. The RNG is genuinely keyed: a fresh
Philox generator per `(purpose, identity)` with no shared state, so drawing for image 500 **cold**
gives the same values as drawing for it after 499 prior draws, reversed iteration order changes
nothing, and — the case SR-18 actually exists for — **a system that outages and skips images still
sees identical draws for the images it does process.** All 18 `run_id_key` fields are covered, and a
missing field raises rather than hashing a partial key; both arms of a comparison share `pair_id`
while holding distinct `run_id`s; the guard fails closed with no manifest *and* with one field
short; and nothing outside `tests/` imports the guarded module, enforced by an AST-walking test.
`config_hash` is byte-identical after the hash helper was generalised, so batch 2's committed
configs did not silently move.

#### ~~Batch 4 — canonical preprocessing contract~~ **DONE 2026-07-28, committed as `eba5bd2`** (SR-19, AM-71)

`src/data/preprocessing.py` now makes the canonical image one immutable uint8 RGB HWC product shared
by codec and encoder paths. The encoder tensor is exactly float32 CHW divided by 255 from that array;
PIL-backed torchvision functional resizing is pinned in the module docstring and every interpolation
and antialias argument is explicit. Evaluation is deterministic, while training crop and flip draws
come from the keyed Philox `augmentation` purpose with the stable sample ID bound into the identity.
The same module owns aspect-preserving codec down/up sampling and clipped PSNR/SSIM.

**AM-71 resolves the only ambiguity found while building it:** stable sample IDs hash the exact
original per-sample source payload bytes before decode or preprocessing, not canonical RGB pixels.
The rejected reading would make a preprocessing amendment change every ID, invalidating committed
split manifests plus all `pair_id` and `noise_id` joins. Synthetic tests prove the ID is invariant
when the canonical output size changes, while different source bytes change it.

Nine focused tests cover bit identity, exact uint8-to-float conversion, deterministic eval,
same-key/different-key augmentation, codec resize direction and aspect failures, analytical PSNR,
effective clipping, and invalid canonical input. The full suite is **63 passed** on CUDA.

**Batch 4 independently adjudicated — structural and behavioural passes complete.** Every previous
batch was independently re-derived rather than read, and two of those passes found real defects
(batch 2's silent `_resolve_choice` fallthrough; batch 1's unanchored `data/` ignore rule). The
structural pass found that `CanonicalProduct` holds one uint8 array frozen with
`setflags(write=False)`, `codec_input` is a copy of it and `encoder_input` is that same array over
255, so there is no second decode path and bit-identity is true by construction rather than by
assertion. All three `# literal-ok` annotations are legitimate (PSNR's ten-times-log, torchvision's
fixed ten crop proposals, the pre-existing subprocess timeout), and AM-71 is enforced structurally:
`canonicalize_image` derives the ID from `source_bytes` and cannot be given a mismatching one.

The behavioural pass used a standalone synthetic probe against `src/data/preprocessing.py`, not the
committed tests. A constant offset `d = 0.25` produced PSNR `12.041199826559`, exactly
`10*log10(1/d**2)`; repeated evaluation tensors were equal; repeated training calls with one keyed
identity were equal while a changed epoch produced different pixels; clipping an out-of-range
reconstruction changed PSNR from `-0.827853703165` to `4.436974992327` and capped its maximum at
1.0; and identical source bytes retained ID `c93463a0e3d57766` across 32×32 and 96×96 canonical
outputs while changed bytes produced `2c5b154581398a18`. The first standalone attempt failed only
because this no-package repository requires `PYTHONPATH=src:tools` outside pytest; rerunning with
the repository source paths supplied passed every assertion. No implementation defect was found.

⚠️ **One SR-22 clause is deferred and must not be forgotten at the freeze.** Its verify clause wants
*an archived freeze manifest whose hashes resolve to the committed code, config, manifests and
checkpoints*. The guard currently checks that every field in
`params.evaluation.freeze_manifest_covers` is **present and non-empty** — not that the hashes
resolve to anything real. That is correct today, because no checkpoints or split manifests exist to
resolve against. It becomes a **G-12 obligation at W11** and is the kind of thing that looks done
because the guard is green.

**Also fixed here, and it was a defect in batch 1:** `.gitignore` carried `data/`, which matches at
any depth and would therefore have silently untracked `src/data/`. It is now `/data/`, anchored to
the repository root. Worth remembering as a class — an unanchored ignore pattern is invisible until
the file it swallowed is needed.

**Checkpoint evidence, preserved separately:** before remediation, batch 4 passed **63 tests**, all
five project checks, and the CUDA probe returned `True`. It was committed without overrides as
`eba5bd21b2d051bb5c0741dd6aa1971eec134392`.

#### AM-72..AM-76 W1 sweep remediation — **DONE 2026-07-29, committed as `8e59535`**

Five implemented-contract defects were repaired before loaders, manifests or results exist:

- `config_hash` now fingerprints schema version + resolved run + immutable snapshots of all thirteen
  scientific/runtime roots; administrative roots remain excluded and mapping order is irrelevant.
- The CPU lock pins `torch==2.13.0+cpu` and `torchvision==0.28.0+cpu` from the official CPU index.
  `tools/verify_cpu_lock.py --clean-install` proved a plain-pip hashed install has
  `torch.version.cuda is None` and no `cuda-*`, `nvidia-*` or `triton` distributions.
- `canonicalize_source(source_bytes, dataset)` is the sole product factory; source decoding is
  private and registry-selected, RNG purposes reject missing/extra identity fields, and SSIM passes
  every public result-affecting argument explicitly with the 0.26.0 Gaussian behaviour fixture.
- Determinism accepts only the two named cuDNN mappings. Python locks no longer claim to provision
  OpenJPEG: loaded version 2.5.4 is verified externally, learned-only metadata may record null, and
  J2K preflight fails before artifact creation.
- Current-document discovery now scans the complete AM-76 scope. The completed batch-2 plan is
  excluded only by its exact historical marker, visible banner and root-resolving `NEXT.md` link.

**Remediation evidence:** **97 tests passed**; at that checkpoint `gen_spec_views.py --check` was **184 requirements (AM-77)
(2 retired)**; current-document consistency scans **11** files and excludes one valid historical
plan; literal lint and packetisation pass; the CPU clean install passes; CUDA returns `True` and a
real 64×64 device matmul completes. Dataset fetching, real decoder registration, loaders, manifests,
classifier training, J2K implementation and Sionna integration remain deliberately out of scope.
This paragraph is checkpoint evidence from before AM-77; the current totals are 185/77.

#### AM-77 dataset provenance and manifests — **DONE 2026-07-29, committed as `2c6f780`**

One registry now covers `imagenette160`, `stl10` and `cifar10`; it accepts only `train` and `val`
and rejects `test` back to SR-22/G-12. Dataset-specific source extraction stays inside registered
adapters, and `canonicalize_source` lazily obtains the three real decoders from that registry. The
public dataset returns immutable source-bound records and canonical products; it does not use
Torchvision transforms or construct canonical products directly.

**Files added:** `src/data/identity.py`, `adapters.py`, `provenance.py`, `manifests.py`,
`registry.py`; `tools/fetch_datasets.py`, `materialize_manifests.py`, `verify_datasets.py`;
`tests/conftest.py`, `test_datasets.py`, `test_manifests.py`, `test_provenance.py`; and the three
CSV paths below. Existing files changed are `.gitignore`, `src/data/preprocessing.py`, the normative
spec plus generated views, and `AGENTS.md`, `NEXT.md`, `README.md`.

**Exact archive provenance, measured from the configured URLs and verified on a second pass:**

| Dataset | Normative URL | Filename | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Imagenette-160 | `https://s3.amazonaws.com/fast-ai-imageclas/imagenette2-160.tgz` | `imagenette2-160.tgz` | 99,003,388 | `64d0c4859f35a461889e0147755a999a48b49bf38a7e0f9bd27003f10db02fe5` |
| STL-10 | `https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/stl10_binary.tar.gz` | `stl10_binary.tar.gz` | 2,640,397,119 | `f31fd99273a1acb8609c8db427cebb1de3f71de77758cdc0e22956e1289b9866` |
| CIFAR-10 | `https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz` | `cifar-10-python.tar.gz` | 170,498,071 | `6d958be074577803d12ecdefd02955f39262c83c16fe9348329d7fe0b5c001ce` |

The large downloads were reachable but throttled and intermittently truncated; exact byte-range
resume against the same normative URLs completed them. Each assembled tar opened cleanly, and the
secondary Torchvision MD5 values matched, but SHA-256 above is the normative check.

**Committed canonical manifests:**

| Dataset | Path | Train / val / test | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Imagenette-160 | `data/manifests/imagenette160.csv` | 8469 / 1000 / 3925 | `224309422f15bf89460559381aea4b00c4779c52d3652f7f679a213369f3f889` |
| STL-10 | `data/manifests/stl10.csv` | 4500 / 500 / 8000 | `67936da779dc0010160b37b3b40001490304a5873eb978d261e3a57947387b47` |
| CIFAR-10 | `data/manifests/cifar10.csv` | 45000 / 5000 / 10000 | `09e9debf4743831ca61f17154a997e60becdd7046a585bdbd94b5db4bf12a537` |

`tools/materialize_manifests.py --check` regenerates them in memory and compares exact UTF-8/LF
bytes. The independent carve re-derivation reproduced class-0 validation quotas of 100, 50 and 500.
The real verifier canonicalized one train and one validation sample per dataset, matched the raw
STL/CIFAR decoders to pinned Torchvision pixels, and scanned every published test payload for
manifest identity with **zero decoder and zero canonicalization calls**. No test image was decoded,
displayed or evaluated. The reference classifier, checkpoints, classifier training and G-1 remain
next and were not started. **Final verification:** 146 tests passed with CUDA available; spec,
documentation, literal, packetisation, archive, manifest, real-data and diff checks all passed; the
CPU lock also passed a clean hashed install with `torch.version.cuda is None`.

### The short version, in order

W1, W2, W3 and W4 are complete, as are G-1, G-2, G-7 and the validation-only transparency-bitrate
probe — W4 including PA, PB_1 (with PB_1C), PB_2 (with PB_2C) and PB_3. The Pascal successor
production campaign and G8_C C3-C7 closeout are complete at 3213/3213, with 153 measured curves
frozen; G8_D D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6 and D7 are complete and GREEN. Corrected-v3 G8_E E1 is frozen pre-data with zero validation coverage; the owner E2–E4 authorization is issued (commit `7a51588`) and production E2 is executing/resumable; the full BR-4 validation sweep and operating-point decision remain later gates.
W4 also includes **PB_3C**, the corrective
phase that fixed the fixed-modulation reference and resumed-campaign validation and froze the
selection policy. The PR-1 literature review and corrected PR-2 Gantt are complete. The user-fixed
First Review deck, four-member rehearsal, PR-9 guide acknowledgement, final package and snapshot remain.

**Two G-1 guardrails that remain binding downstream:**

- **The identity/pairing keys (SR-18), manifest-bound registry (SR-2/SR-17) and test guard (SR-22)
  are already implemented.** The AM-77 path reuses the stable IDs and exposes no second model-facing
  test path. `run_id` alone used to *collide* between validation and test.
- **G-1 was validation-only and proved zero test decoder, canonicalization and inference calls.**
  Keep the test boundary sealed until G-12; G-1 passing does not release it.

**And one habit worth keeping.** This round found a passing evidence script that violated four rules
it claimed to enforce, and then a follow-up audit found that the round's *own* schedule edits had
reopened the leak they closed (AM-60). Both were caught by re-deriving rather than re-reading. When
you change a rule and the schedule that obeys it in the same sitting, read one against the other
afterwards — AM-47 exists for exactly this and still did not catch it.

---

0. ~~**§2 sign-off · MATLAB licence · the LDPC spike.**~~ **All closed 2026-07-25/27** (AM-19,
   AM-21..AM-25). Two consequences worth keeping in view rather than re-deriving: the hypotheses were
   **delegated**, so this repo's git history is the *sole* preregistration record for H1–H4 — never
   edit a hypothesis in place, always a new `AM` citing the old one; and "try your best for a
   crossover" authorises strengthening the baseline, never weakening the learned system.

1. ~~⚠️ **Fetch the srsRAN vectors.**~~ **DONE 2026-07-28.** `spec/evidence/srsran_vectors/` holds
   **276 `.dat` files (7.2 MB)** plus `ldpc_encoder_test_data.h`, all three
   `params.baseline.ldpc_golden_vector_sha256` checksums verified OK, and `.gitignore` keeps them
   out of git as designed. **The §16 risk is now materially smaller**: if upstream disappears, the
   fixture still builds here — but the data lives only on this machine, so it is not in a backup and
   a clean checkout elsewhere still needs the network or rung 4. Re-run
   `spec/evidence/fetch_srsran_vectors.sh` to reproduce; original text below for the reasoning.

   The script is committed and pins an immutable release; the asset returned HTTP 200 on 2026-07-27
   and again on 2026-07-28.
   The upstream repo is **archived** and AM-30 established that **OCUDU publishes no replacement** —
   its vectors moved to a MATLAB-companion plugin that needs a licensed 5G Toolbox. So if this asset
   is withdrawn, rung 2 is gone permanently and G-2 degrades to the single hand-derived floor case.
   Pull it now, keep it outside git (`spec/evidence/.gitignore` already handles that), and W3 stops
   depending on someone else's hosting decision.

2. **W1 — repo scaffold through G-1.** Build strictly in this order; each step is the input to the
   next, and three of them contaminate everything downstream if retrofitted. **G-1 is now much wider
   than an accuracy number** (AM-58): it also accepts the dataset checksums, the split manifests, the
   registry, the config round-trip, the canonical-pixel identity test, the clean-install smoke run
   and the classifier's provenance — and it is **validation-only**, with SR-22's guard in place to
   prove zero test reads. Everything below is a G-1 acceptance item, not just step (f).

   **(a) Environment lock (SR-21, AM-61) — DONE in batch 1 and AM-73 remediation.**
   See the cold-start block above for the verification commands.
   `requirements.txt` stays tooling-only by design; the runtime stack is `requirements.in` →
   `requirements.lock` (hashed, committed), resolved by **`uv`** and installed from
   `params.environment.torch_index_url`. The implementation also sets
   `params.environment.deterministic_backend`, captures driver/device into run metadata per
   `params.environment.record_in_run_metadata`, provides a **CPU-only install path** for analysis and
   demo, and passes the `pip --require-hashes` portability check.

   **All pins resolved 2026-07-28 — every one has a `cp314` wheel, nothing is guesswork:**
   `torch==2.13.0+cu130` · `torchvision==0.28.0+cu130` (from the cu130 index; the wheel is
   `torchvision-0.28.0+cu130-cp314-cp314-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl`) · `sionna-no-rt==2.0.1`
   (W3, not W1) · `numpy 2.5.1` · `pillow 12.3.0` · `scikit-image 0.26.0` · `pytest 9.1.1`.
   The W1 pins are installed together in the repository `.venv` and the 146-test suite passes on the
   RTX 4060. `sionna-no-rt` remains intentionally deferred to W3; it was proven separately in the W0
   spike environment, not as part of the W1 lock.

   **(b) Config plumbing (SR-1) — DONE in batch 2 and AM-72 remediation.**
   `src/config/` reads `spec/params.generated.yaml`, provides the resolved immutable `RunConfig` and
   complete versioned `config_hash`, and `tools/check_literals.py` enforces the source-literal rule.

   **(c) Preprocessing contract (SR-19) — DONE in batch 4 and AM-74 remediation.**
   `src/data/preprocessing.py` owns the source-bound canonical **uint8 RGB HWC** product and derives
   the encoder tensor and codec input from it. AM-77 registers all three real decoders through that
   boundary without adding a second decode or pixel-normalisation path.

   **(d) Splits (SR-17) — DONE in committed AM-77 batch `2c6f780`, together with (e) and (e2).** Deterministic val carve from the
   *published train* split using
   `params.evaluation.split_seed` (1337). The arithmetic lines up with the real datasets, which is
   worth knowing before you debug a count: Imagenette v2-160 ships 9469 train / 3925 val, so
   9469 − 1000 = 8469 train, 1000 val, and the published val becomes the 3925-image **test** split;
   STL-10 is 5000 labelled + 8000 test → 4500 + 500 + 8000; CIFAR-10 is 50000 + 10000 →
   45000 + 5000 + 10000. Disjointness, exact counts, enumeration-order invariance and the
   provenance-only zero-decoder/canonicalization boundary are covered by tests; the AST guard still
   enforces that model-facing test access lives in one module nothing else imports.

   **(d2) Identity and pairing keys (SR-18) — DONE in batch 3.**
   Four keys, not one: `run_id` (content-addressed over the full `params.artifacts.run_id_key`,
   including `split`, config and checkpoint hashes and the classifier variant — the old key omitted
   all of them and **collided** between validation and test), `noise_id`, `analysis_cell_id`, and a
   system-independent `pair_id` that ER-10 joins on. RNG must be **counter-based and keyed** over
   `params.artifacts.rng_purposes`, never a sequential stream consumed on demand — systems outage on
   different images, so a shared seed desynchronises exactly when it matters. Per-image rows carry
   every join column and a **stable sample ID**, not a positional index.

   **(e) Dataset registry (SR-2, SR-20) — DONE in committed AM-77 batch `2c6f780`; the note that used to sit here was wrong.**
   ⚠️ **Imagenette IS in torchvision**: `torchvision.datasets.Imagenette(root, split=..., size="160px",
   download=True)`, checked against current upstream docs. This file previously asserted the
   opposite and sent you to build a bespoke public path. The project registry uses the configured
   loader identity and normative URL, verifies its own pinned archive byte length/SHA-256, and keeps
   exact source-record extraction inside dataset-specific adapters whose pixels match pinned
   Torchvision 0.28.0 behaviour. All three go through one caller-facing path; CIFAR-10 is a plumbing
   path only (DEC-1) but still instantiates because SR-2's verify clause covers every dataset.
   Storage headroom is not a concern:
   more than 800 GB was free on 2026-07-29.

   **(e2) Split manifests (SR-17) — DONE in committed AM-77 batch `2c6f780`; a seed is not a split.** Loader ordering and library behaviour
   change between versions, so materialise the carve as a **committed manifest** of stable sample IDs
   under `params.datasets.manifest_dir`, hashed into run metadata. Stratified, ordered by stable ID
   before drawing, with the named RNG. Class indices come from sorted authoritative Imagenette WNIDs,
   STL-10 `class_names.txt` order and CIFAR-10 `batches.meta` label-name order.

   **(e3) Test-access guard (SR-22) — DONE in batch 3; loader integration completed in AM-77.**
   `src/data/test_access.py` fails closed without a freeze manifest and is the sole allowed
   test boundary. The release point is **G-12 at W11** — not G-10, which now sits at the start of W9
   (AM-60). The ordinary registry rejects test, and the provenance-only scan records zero decoder
   and canonicalization calls. G-1 extended that proof through the classifier: the full path
   constructs only train/validation views, the guarded module remained structurally isolated, and
   there was zero model-facing test loading, inference or accuracy computation.
   Resolving the freeze-manifest hashes against real manifests
   and checkpoints remains deliberately deferred to G-12.

   **(f) Reference classifier (BR-8, DEC-15) — DONE; G-1 PASS 2026-07-29.**
   The committed AM-78 contract uses ResNet-18 **from scratch** from
   `configs/reference-classifier-clean.yaml`; it accepts unnormalised tensors and applies the
   configured channel normalization as its first model operation. Initialization is the isolated
   keyed identity `(init, train_seed, reference_classifier.<arch>)`; each train epoch has an
   independent keyed Philox permutation `(batch_order, train_seed, epoch)`. The recipe is
   now fully specified in `params.reference_classifier` — SGD+momentum, lr 0.1, momentum 0.9, weight
   decay 5e-4, cosine with 5 warmup epochs, 100 epochs, batch 128, label smoothing 0.1, and
   `[random_resized_crop, horizontal_flip]`. **Read it from config; do not improvise one** — the
   absence of that recipe was a straight SR-1 violation on the artifact that gates G-1 *and* defines
   the denominator of ER-3's whole selection rule (AM-27). Training is validation-only, performs
   integer-count top-1 selection with earliest-epoch ties, and atomically saves portable checkpoints
   identified by exact finalized-file SHA-256. The full fresh campaign completed epochs 0–99 with
   100 exact validation records and selected 898/1000 = 0.898 at epoch 99. The best and final
   checkpoint ID is
   `9c37362347a0203597d6e8e9d9a58fde30ba286f3cec9b4d2f800bd8a3256002`.

   **G-1's `clean_acc_floor` = 0.88 on Imagenette passed in the clean variant on validation.**
   STL-10's and CIFAR-10's floors remain advisory (AM-13). The fallback is an **ordered ladder**
   rather than a licence (AM-58):
   `params.reference_classifier.fallback_ladder` — extend to 150 epochs, then ResNet-34, then
   ResNet-50 — selected on validation, stopping at the first rung that clears the floor, and still
   bound by SR-14's cap that the learned arm may not exceed the network scoring the classical arm.
   **Do not start it:** the base recipe cleared the floor.

   **Artifact ignore policy is already in place:** `.gitignore` excludes root `/data/`,
   `checkpoints/` and `results/per_image/`. Aggregate `results/*.csv` stays **tracked**, because ER-7
   requires every thesis number to resolve to a committed CSV, and so do
   `params.artifacts.inference_summary_file` and `params.artifacts.per_image_manifest` — the
   inference summary is new (AM-57) and exists because the aggregate schema cannot hold an interval
   bound, a p-value or a verdict, i.e. exactly the numbers §2 turns on.

   The trained classifier released downstream scoring work, W2/G-7 are complete, and the
   validation-only transparency-bitrate probe has now finished without changing the classifier.

3. **Build BR-2's fixture when W3 approaches — the design is settled, the work is not done.** The
   spec now specifies a committed fetch-and-convert script that pins release `release_25_10`, verifies
   `params.baseline.ldpc_golden_vector_sha256`, and leaves the `.npz` untracked, plus a committed
   hand-derived floor case that always runs. Two things to carry over from the W0 probe:
   - **Pin the lifting size.** 85 of the 102 upstream cases were skipped in the probe only because
     Sionna infers Z from (k, n) and picked a different one. That is a probe limitation, not a
     disagreement — every structurally valid comparison matched exactly. Pinning Z unlocks the rest.
   - **The comparison can only cover rates above each base graph's minimum**, since Sionna refuses to
     encode below them. Say so in the fixture rather than quietly truncating.

4. **Transparency bitrate — probe complete, G-8 still unresolved.** The old `r ≈ 1/5` planning
   estimate rested on visual transparency around 1.5–2.0 bpp at 160 px. The frozen validation-only
   task probe instead forecasts its 5 pp condition at mean 0.408654 bpp and its 2 pp condition at
   mean 0.987788 bpp. These forecasts are evidence for later engineering, not replacements for the
   provisional ratios and not a G-8 selection. No ImageNet-pretrained proxy was used, and
   DEC-15 continues to ban pretrained weights for the reference classifier. ⚠️ **AM-30 sharpened why
   this matters:**
   §16 now records the 1.5–2.0 bpp figure as the weakest number in the spec — it is a *visual*
   transparency threshold applied to an *accuracy* criterion, and classification tolerates several
   times more compression, so ER-3's rule may bite much further down the ladder than the provisional
   ratios suggest. `r_1_48` and `params.bandwidth.ladder_bottom_saturation_rule` exist to catch that.

5. **Re-check that W3 still fits.** DEC-16 added 2–3 days of 16-QAM soft-demapping to a week that
   already holds LDPC integration, BER validation and bit accounting. May need resequencing. The
   16-QAM demapper is now the *only* place the AM-24 LLR-sign trap can bite again — it is the same
   convention, one level harder.

## Open questions for the user

- **Pascal worker status — settled for the current path.** The qualified
  `confessor_pascal_cu126` profile is the sole writer for the clean successor
  campaign, with both explicit UUID-bound GPUs authenticated. The old cu130
  suffix is immutable superseded history and is never resumed or mixed into the
  successor. No launch authorization exists in this readiness task; the owner
  will open science separately after the merged-main handoff.
- ~~**srsRAN golden-vector licensing.**~~ **Delegated and decided 2026-07-27 (AM-25):** "do what's
  best, I don't have a preference". Chosen: **don't vendor.** The premise turned out to be wrong —
  srsRAN never committed the vector data, it ships as a per-release asset — so the fixture fetches
  from a pinned immutable release, verifies SHA-256, and keeps the `.npz` out of git. No AGPL data in
  the submitted artifact, byte-exactness still provable. The offline-reproducibility cost that made
  this look like the lossy option is paid off by promoting rung 4 from *fallback* to *always-run
  floor*. If challenged, the argument is: checksums are facts about a file, not copies of one.
- **MATLAB licence** — still pending an outcome, and now fully off the critical path: rung 2 is not
  merely available, it is demonstrated working (AM-25). OPT-1/OPT-3 remain provisional upside.
- ~~**The actual 2026-27 review dates.**~~ **Closed 2026-07-28 (AM-59)** — and it did not need you.
  The circular is scanned images with *no extractable text*, which this file had recorded as if it
  meant unreadable; rendering the two pages to PNG and reading them resolves all four dates directly.
  Lesson worth keeping: "no extractable text" is a statement about `pdftotext`, not about the
  document. The guess was half wrong — Final Review is **W17**, not W16.
- ~~**Proposal registration status.**~~ **Closed 2026-07-28 (AM-63):** the author confirmed
  registration is complete. The blank template in the repository was not evidence either way.
- ⚠️ **The hardware-alternative decision, due before W4 (PR-9).** Circular clause 5: projects are
  *expected* to have a hardware implementation, "if not, at least they should have significant design
  aspects with an application to real world problems". Tier 1 can satisfy that, but only if the design
  work is written down as design work — hence the deployment dossier. Ask the guide early enough that
  the schedule can absorb the answer, and record the acknowledgement. This must **not** be allowed to
  turn into a promise of Tier 2/3 scope (DEC-14, HR-5).
- **Name a real BLER reference before G-2.** `params.baseline.ldpc_bler_reference_source` is pending.
  TS 38.212 is a specification and contains no curve to match, so the old wording named nothing
  obtainable. Needs a downloadable, checksummed dataset agreeing on (K,N), base graph, lifting size,
  modulation, decoder algorithm, offset, iterations and SNR convention.

## Recently settled — don't reopen

- **LDPC = Sionna 2.0.1** (DEC-10). Sionna dropped TensorFlow in 2.0.0; the DEC-3 objection is dead.
  Segmentation is ours, behind the BR-14 seam.
- **Crossover strategy = adaptive modulation** (DEC-16), with dominance-everywhere as an explicitly
  last-resort fallback. Never cap modulation back to QPSK to "simplify".
- **§2 is not pass/fail on a crossover.** Completion is running the protocol properly — and the
  supervisor has now ratified exactly that (AM-19), so this is settled externally, not just
  internally. Pursue the crossover hard; report dominance if it doesn't appear.
- **Two operating points, not one** (AM-20). ER-3's rule runs at 5 pp → `efficiency_ratio` and at
  2 pp → `crossover_ratio`; ER-1's headline sits at the crossover point. Both are lookups on the same
  classical sweep table, so the second costs nothing to select. They may coincide — that's a clean
  outcome, not a failure. Don't collapse this back to one threshold: 5 pp alone can select a ratio
  where no crossover exists, which is the whole reason the second threshold is there.
- **H1's run rule stays** (AM-4). The "three consecutive points is a multiple-comparisons problem"
  objection is backwards — the run requirement is the multiplicity control, and the bound is now
  written into §2. Expect this one to come back; the arithmetic is there so you don't re-derive it.
- **ER-9 keeps entropy coding** (AM-5), bounded to a static offline-fitted coder. Dropping it would
  weaken the control that exists to *deny* joint-coding credit, which makes H4 easier to pass — the
  wrong direction to be wrong in.
- **Read `SPEC.md` §17 before acting on any future review.** Seventy-seven amendments across fifteen
  rounds now record what changed and why, including recommendations that were already settled.
  AM-24 and AM-25 are the W0 spike; note that AM-25 corrects a *factual premise* of AM-22 and AM-23
  (srsRAN's vectors were never committed to git), which is why it is a new entry and not an edit —
  §17 is append-only and superseded entries stay wrong in place, on purpose.

## Session log

- **2026-08-25 (read-only F1/review/health audit; no state change)** — Three parallel read-only
  audits ran in detached worktrees at `b7e67c59`; nothing was executed, trained or modified.
  (i) Integrity: computed SHA-256 of `results/baseline/g8_f/f0_v3_execution_authorization.json`
  (`391cd815…`) and `f1_launch_authorization.json` (`4265b696…`) both MATCH the frozen values;
  no tracked F1 progress evidence exists anywhere in Git (HEAD is the launch commit itself), and
  the sole-writer runtime under `/home/nick` on this host is not readable by this account, so the
  external runtime remains authoritative for F1 progress. (ii) First Review package: both 12-slide
  decks, the 30-reference literature review, corrected Gantt, deployment dossier and presenter
  guide are complete; still open are the human-gated author deck approval, four-member rehearsal,
  guide acknowledgement (record still all-"Not yet recorded"), and the final package freeze plus
  the annotated `review-1-basis` snapshot, which deliberately does not exist yet. Note the
  2026-08-18–22 window has passed while those gates sit open; whether the review occurred is not
  recorded in the repo. (iii) Repo health: `gen_spec_views.py --check`, `check_doc_consistency.py`
  and `check_literals.py` all PASS with zero findings; dataset/manifest/W4/G8_E verifiers were
  ENV-LIMITED only (dependency-light venv lacking numpy/glymur, git-ignored archives absent from a
  clean worktree) — no HOLD or evidence mismatch surfaced. Next: unchanged — monitor the external
  F1 sole writer without restart; F2/pass two/test remain closed pending owner authorization.
- **2026-07-30 (validation-only transparency-bitrate probe complete)** — Froze the design before
  measurement, loaded checkpoint
  `9c37362347a0203597d6e8e9d9a58fde30ba286f3cec9b4d2f800bd8a3256002` without the training-resume
  path, and reproduced its clean 898/1000 validation result. OpenJPEG 2.5.4 through Glymur 0.14.3
  encoded raw irreversible-9/7 RPCL codestreams at 17 fixed byte budgets and all four committed
  axes. The full stable-ID result has 68,000 cells, no infeasible encodes and no decode failures.
  Selection-aware 10,000-resample paired bootstrap forecasts the 5 pp threshold at 1,330 bytes
  (axis 128, mean 0.408654 bpp, accuracy 0.870, lower bound −0.041) and the 2 pp threshold at 3,200
  bytes (axis 160, mean 0.987788 bpp, accuracy 0.886, lower bound −0.018). Neither result is
  censored. They do not select or replace a G-8 operating point; G-8 remains unresolved. No training
  ran, test remained sealed, and W4/G-8 did not start. Next: W3 LDPC fixture/integration, BER/BLER,
  and complete packetisation/bit accounting through G-2.
- **2026-07-29 (W2 complete; G-7 PASS)** — Started from clean `8462082`; committed the channel,
  power, keyed-noise, PAPR, task-head, loss and `djscc_residual_v1` foundation as
  `26b631ede27a6f88f1d004a66b845c52a658e07c`. All 18 dataset/ratio symbol budgets and both
  parameter caps pass. A training-only CUDA smoke completed forward/backward/Adam without writing a
  checkpoint. G-7 profiled the clean implementation commit on the RTX 4060 Laptop GPU: 8,469
  examples, 265 batches, batch 32, 35.1711091640027 s, 0.899843 GiB allocated, 1.003906 GiB
  reserved, 0.976975 h projected for 100 epochs, and 1,640,957 parameters. The primary architecture
  passed, so no width fallback was implemented. The offline verifier and all mutation classes pass.
  Only training data and synthetic fixtures were used; test stayed sealed, G-1 remained valid, no
  full learned campaign or constrained variant ran, and SR-16 all-system reporting remains
  downstream. Next: transparency-bitrate probe, then W3/W4.
- **2026-07-30 (G-7 implementation binding repaired; G-7 still PASS)** — The original profiler
  verified a separate clean W2 worktree but imported project modules from the evidence checkout.
  The corrected orchestration now preflights and executes every critical module from the detached
  `26b631e` worktree, rejects path or byte drift, and records executed-byte SHA-256 and git blob SHA
  identities in the report. The rerun completed 8,469 examples in 48.68431210900235 s, reserved
  1.00390625 GiB, projected 1.352342003027843 h for 100 epochs, and retained the 1,640,957-parameter
  primary architecture. G-7 remains PASS; test stayed sealed and no checkpoint or training campaign
  was created.
- **2026-07-29 (full Imagenette campaign; G-1 PASS; W1 complete)** — Started from the clean committed
  classifier implementation `89a3af48c48a91d6d272ba62337f890c59bb40a5`; no production artifact
  existed, so the exact `--full-run` command ran fresh and uninterrupted through epoch 99. Best and
  final validation were both 898/1000 = 0.898 at epoch 99, above the 0.88 floor. Final/best
  checkpoint `9c37362347a0203597d6e8e9d9a58fde30ba286f3cec9b4d2f800bd8a3256002`; config
  `a9717575d71f2b3e9dd411b10b7735bdb3946c985fead48cb3c5af07423f12e1`; manifest
  `224309422f15bf89460559381aea4b00c4779c52d3652f7f679a213369f3f889`. Independent verification
  reproduced the count-derived history, exact earliest-tie selection, keyed epoch ordering,
  optimizer/scheduler recipe, full lineage and all identities; transactional full resume accepted
  the checkpoint. Wider archive/manifest, split, registry, config, preprocessing, environment,
  accelerator and provenance obligations passed. The test boundary remained sealed with zero
  test decode, canonicalization, model-facing load, inference or accuracy calls. W2 is open; its
  channel/power/PAPR/DJSCC/profiling work through G-7 is next. The older staged entries below remain
  point-in-time history.
- **2026-07-29 (final pre-G-1 trainer-integrity correction, staged)** — Base `b99bbdf33a4f0dbb762ef1215ed90624e85f1d4c`. Closed three additional production-integrity gaps without an AM: only official `run_epochs(..., execution_mode="full", full_run_requested=True)` can establish full lineage and it internally constructs the manifest-backed training/validation views; all public direct epoch hooks are irreversible smoke/test lineage, and full mode rejects injected datasets or bounds before state/artifact mutation. The full CLI also defers production artifact creation until that official path. Resume now compares the complete fresh optimizer param-group schema, cardinality, types and values (with only the epoch LR substitution), and validates/recomputes count-derived validation accuracy, configured full validation schedule and earliest-tie best state before saving or restoring. Regression coverage added for direct hooks, dataset injection, full constructor ownership, CLI artifact ordering, full/smoke resume, all optimizer fields/schema/group mutations, validation count/schedule/best-state mutations and transactional invariance. Focused `62 passed`; classifier-related `114 passed`; complete `250 passed`; spec/doc/literal/packetisation/archive/manifest/dataset checks passed. Manual arbitrary-data, `maximize`, inconsistent-count and missing-scheduled-validation exploit cases all rejected. Full Imagenette training and G-1 were not run. Next: user review of staged corrective diff.
- **2026-07-29 (reference-classifier pre-G-1 batch staged)** — **AM-78; 185 → 186 requirements and 77 → 78 amendments.** Added fail-closed extraction-marker binding and Range-resumable archive finalization, the immutable dedicated classifier configuration, source-ID augmentation views, isolated keyed model initialization, keyed epoch ordering, model-owned normalization, validation-only SGD, exact warmup/cosine scheduling, atomic portable checkpoints and direct-epoch resume. The complete network-free suite passed `192`; three real CUDA Imagenette steps and a resume step passed under ignored `checkpoints/smoke/`, with checkpoint hashes `669c82a1…bd2345c` and `90787eda…8ab627`. Full 100-epoch Imagenette training was not started and G-1 was not executed. Next: review/commit this batch, then run the preregistered full Imagenette campaign as its own evidence batch.
- **2026-07-29 (AM-77 committed and cold-start handoff refreshed)** — The complete dataset
  registry/provenance/manifest batch was committed as `2c6f780`. Current status text now points
  directly to the reference classifier and validation-only G-1; there is no staged implementation
  batch, no unresolved loader integration, and no pending archive or manifest provenance.
- **2026-07-29 (W1 dataset provenance/manifests, staged)** — **AM-77; 184 → 185 requirements and 76 → 77 amendments.** Added `src/data/{identity,adapters,provenance,manifests,registry}.py`, `tools/{fetch_datasets,materialize_manifests,verify_datasets}.py`, three focused test modules plus synthetic fixtures, and the three tracked canonical CSV manifests. The configured archives were fetched from their exact URLs, measured and pinned by byte length and SHA-256, verified again before extraction, then independently cross-checked against readable tar structure and Torchvision's MD5. Manifest generation found the exact expected 13,394 / 13,000 / 60,000 totals with no duplicate source IDs; `--check` reproduced every byte. Real train/validation samples canonicalized at 160×160, 96×96 and 32×32, and a full provenance-only published-test scan recorded zero decoder/canonicalization calls. No test image was decoded or evaluated. The network was available but each long connection was throttled and intermittently truncated, so the exact same normative objects were completed with resumable byte ranges; CUDA remained available. Reference classifier work and validation-only G-1 remain next.
- **2026-07-29 (future-work documentation audit)** — Re-read the current handoff against the
repository and G-1. Corrected the obsolete no-GPU pytest count, marked batches 1–4 contracts as
  landed inside the long-form W1 checklist, removed the already-completed ignore rules and proposal
  registration from pending work, and made the next dependency chain explicit: real decoders and
  one dataset registry → archive provenance/checksums → committed split manifests → reference
  classifier → validation-only G-1. No normative requirement, parameter or gate changed.
- **2026-07-29 (W1 sweep remediation, committed)** — **SR-19 checkpoint committed as `eba5bd2`;
  AM-72..AM-76 remediation committed as `8e59535`.** The checkpoint was accepted only
  after exact ten-path scope, no unstaged/untracked files, no remediation markers and
  `git diff --cached --check` all passed; its evidence remains 63 tests, five project checks and
  CUDA `True`. The new batch closes thin config fingerprints, the CUDA-bearing CPU lock, public
  decoded-pixel construction, arbitrary RNG identities, SSIM defaults, open-ended determinism,
  overstated OpenJPEG provisioning and fixed-list documentation coverage. New acceptance evidence:
  97 tests, 184 requirements / 76 amendments, 11 current documentation files plus one valid
  historical-plan exclusion, clean CPU plain-pip install with no CUDA distributions, and live CUDA
  matmul. Next remains the W1 dataset registry, archive checksums and split manifests; real decoder
  registration lands with that loader batch.
- **2026-07-28 (W1 batch 4, staged)** — **Canonical preprocessing contract implemented; SR-19
  complete, AM-71 resolves stable source bytes, 63 tests passing.** Canonicalisation is an immutable
  uint8 RGB HWC product; encoder and codec inputs derive from the same pixels, augmentation uses the
  keyed Philox `augmentation` stream, evaluation is deterministic, and codec resampling plus clipped
  PSNR/SSIM are pinned. The source-ID alternative was tested rather than left verbal: the same source
  bytes retain one ID across different canonical output sizes, while changed bytes produce a new ID.
  CUDA initialised successfully and a real device matmul ran before the full suite.
- **2026-07-28 (W1 batch 3, `72be2af`)** — **Identity keys, keyed RNG and the test-access guard;
  SR-18 and SR-22 implemented, no amendment needed, 54 tests passing.** The cleanest batch of the
  three, and the one that mattered most: these are the pieces that cannot be retrofitted once results
  exist. Every claim was re-derived rather than read — the RNG's control-flow invariance, all 18
  `run_id_key` fields, the pairing join's rejection of duplicate and missing trajectories, the
  guard's three failure modes, the import-graph isolation, and a `config_hash` regression check
  confirming batch 2's committed configs did not move when the hash helper was generalised. Details
  in the batch 3 block above, including the **deferred SR-22 hash-resolution clause** that becomes a
  G-12 obligation at W11.

  **Two environment facts worth carrying, because they shape who can do what.** The parallel agent
  (Codex, same WSL2 machine) reported `torch.cuda.is_available()` **False** with *"Failed to
  initialize NVML: GPU access blocked by the operating system"*, and `curl` to the Imagenette URL
  returning nothing — **both device and network blocked at the time** — while an unsandboxed shell on
  the same box sees the RTX 4060 (driver 592.82) and gets **HTTP 200** from
  `params.datasets.imagenette160.source_url`; both measured, not assumed, and an earlier draft of this
  line inferred the S3 reachability from a `download.pytorch.org` fetch, which is a different host and
  proved nothing. **This is a sandbox policy, not hardware, and it can change between sessions — so
  probe it with the three commands in the cold-start block rather than trusting this paragraph.**
  Because the box is WSL2, the GPU appears as `/dev/dxg` with the driver shim at
  `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi`; an agent looking for `/dev/nvidia*` will wrongly conclude the machine
  has no GPU. Consequence, while it holds: preprocessing and split
  logic can be done sandboxed, but **the SR-20 dataset fetch and the BR-8 classifier training
  cannot**, and those are the two hard dependencies for G-1. The two GPU-bound tests
  (`test_cuda_is_available`, `test_environment_record_is_fully_populated`) will keep failing in that
  environment and must keep not being skipped — they are a correct signal, not noise.
- **2026-07-28 (W1 batch 2, `2b23c1e`)** — **Config plumbing and SR-1 literal lint;
  AM-68..AM-70, 175 → 178 requirements.** Added a deeply frozen resolved `RunConfig`, canonical
  SHA-256 hashing, learned/classical experiment-choice YAMLs, and a parameter-driven AST lint that
  catches negative SNRs as `UnaryOp(USub, Constant)` and requires a reason on every exception.
  Mutation tests prove bare `7`, bare `-8`, and an empty `# literal-ok:` fail. The README status and
  its doc-consistency regression were repaired, PR-9 was removed from the First Review readiness
  column, and AM-70 corrected §16's H4 deadline to before G-12 without moving any gate or schedule
  row. Spec, documentation, literal and packetisation checks pass. In this agent environment the
  CUDA wheel is correct (`torch 2.13.0+cu130`, built for CUDA 13.0), but OS policy blocks NVML/device
  access, so the two deliberately unskipped GPU-runtime tests remain expected failures here and must
  be rerun on the primary device before the author signs the commit. **Confirmed 36 passed on the
  primary device**, so the two failures were environmental exactly as reported. **Adjudication then
  found one real defect, and it is the lesson worth keeping:** `_resolve_choice` silently returned
  the raw string when a symbolic name failed to resolve, so `train_snr_db: train_snr_db_fixedd` — a
  one-character typo — was *accepted*, resolved to the literal string instead of `7`, and flowed
  into `config_hash`. `bw_ratio` was protected by `_validate_named_choices`; `train_snr_db` and
  `lambda` were not, and the test suite covered only the happy path. Fixed by requiring resolution
  whenever a symbolically-namespaced choice carries a **string**, while numeric values still pass
  through untouched, so a config that hard-codes a number keeps working and the classical file — which
  has no `lambda` at all — still loads. Both the defect and the fix were verified by *running* the
  typo, not by reading the diff, which is the same habit that caught the AM-24 LLR sign and AM-58's
  passing-but-wrong evidence script.
- **2026-07-28 (W1 batch 1)** — **First commit of project code; AM-65..AM-67, 172 → 175
  requirements.** The environment is locked, installed and asserted: torch 2.13.0+cu130 on CUDA 13.0,
  torchvision 0.28.0+cu130, driver 592.82, `torch.cuda.is_available()` True, 18 tests passing. All
  three spec checks still pass. **The hand-off named the wrong unknown.** It flagged the cu130 extra
  index under `--generate-hashes` as "the one real unknown"; that resolved cleanly once
  `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` was passed. The actual defects were both in what the lockfile
  *contains*, and neither was visible from reading: a runtime-only lock would have had `uv pip sync`
  **uninstall PyYAML** and break every check that guards the spec (AM-65 — caught before it fired),
  and a lock compiled without `--emit-index-url` records **no index at all**, so nothing can install
  it — including the plain `pip install --require-hashes` that SR-21's portability clause requires,
  which means that clause had never been testable (AM-66 — caught by the install failing, with an
  error naming only the version and never the index). Both flags are now parameters rather than shell
  history, because the lockfile is regenerated whenever a pin moves. Also corrected two claims this
  file carried: `.pytest_cache/` was already in `.gitignore`, and the pins were **not** "proven
  working together" in the W0 spike venv — that venv has no torchvision, no scikit-image, no glymur
  and no pytest, so the torch/torchvision co-resolution was untested until this session. Both tests
  were checked for *bite* rather than assumed: `assert_cuda` was run against a simulated CPU build,
  and `test_doc_consistency.py` was run against a mutant checker with the AM-62 exemption bug
  reintroduced — only the exemption case failed, which is the point, since the other two cases cannot
  tell the buggy checker from the correct one. Operational notes for re-running the install:
  `pypi.nvidia.com` timed out twice under default concurrency, `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=900
  UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=2` got it through, and **never pipe the install through `tail`** — `$?`
  then reports the pipe and a failed sync reads as a success, which happened once here.
- **2026-07-28 (end of session)** — **PR-10 closed (AM-63); First Review package specified (AM-64);
  batch 1 written up for a cold start.** Registration confirmed complete, which closes the last item
  no audit could resolve and the only one with no graceful degradation. Reading the rubric
  spreadsheet against the repo then found that **a third of the First Review has no artifact behind
  it**: it scores six criteria at 5 sub-marks each, and *Problem Survey* is PR-1 while *Time Plan* is
  PR-2 — neither of which exists. AM-64 adds `params.deliverables.review_package_dir`, the snapshot
  mechanism (an annotated **tag**, not a branch — a branch diverges, reads as N commits behind and
  invites a merge that must not happen), and `review_1_ready_when` = PR-1 + PR-2 + G-1 as a checkable
  trigger. The ⏰ standing trigger at the top of this file fires on it and is the reminder Nick asked
  for. Also settled, after working through the amendment record: **stop
  auditing the specification.** The trajectory is 25 → 23 → 7 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 entries per round;
  every fatal finding landed in rounds 0–3 and the last was AM-55; rounds 6 and 8 found only
  self-inflicted damage. A stopping rule of "audit until two agents return GO" was considered and
  **rejected as re-rollable** — with enough draws two GOs appear regardless of the spec's state, which
  is preregistration discipline applied to the science but not to the process gating it. Three of
  EXT-6's own 22 release-checklist items (#7 tested IDs, #8 committed manifests, #11 the lockfile)
  are W1 deliverables, so its exit criterion is partly circular and cannot be closed by reading.
- **2026-07-28 (earlier)** — **`check_doc_consistency.py` committed (AM-62); vectors archived;
  `uv` chosen; hand-off written for a cold start.** The tool exists because the same propagation
  failure happened three rounds running and `gen_spec_views.py --check` could never have seen any of
  them — it validates `SPEC.md` against itself, while all three failures were in the hand-written
  files. Its rule is this repo's own convention mechanised: a superseded value may appear only in a
  block that cites the amendment that superseded it. **It was tested by injecting drift, not by
  trusting that it passed** — which immediately found two bugs in it: line-by-line checking flagged
  correctly-labelled history (back-references sit a line or two below the value, so it works on
  blocks now), and an amendment number that does not exist was still granting exemptions, so the
  back-reference rule could be defeated by citing anything at all (cited AM numbers are now
  intersected with the real set). That is the AM-58 lesson applied to the checker itself — and the
  tool then caught the invented number this very log entry originally used to describe the test. `fetch_srsran_vectors.sh` run: 276 files, 7.2 MB, all three checksums OK, gitignored — so
  §16's "the upstream repo is archived and could vanish" risk is now materially smaller, with the
  residual being that the data lives on this machine only. `params.environment.lock_tool` = **`uv`**
  (AM-61), the author's choice over `pip-tools`; both emit the required format, `uv` handles the
  separate CUDA wheel index more cleanly, and that index is the exact mechanism AM-23 showed can
  silently produce a CPU build. **No implementation was started** — deliberately, so the next session
  begins clean rather than inheriting half a scaffold. The cold-start block at the top of "Do next"
  is written to be executable without reading this log: it carries the verified machine state, the
  three drift checks to run first, the install commands, and the two traps in them.

- **2026-07-28 (later still)** — **Cross-document consistency audit (`INT-5`); AM-60, 166 → 168.**
  Ran every hand-written file against the amended spec after round 5, which was large and touched the
  schedule. Found one substantive defect **of round 5's own making**: AM-58 moved W10's rehearsal onto
  validation and AM-59 moved G-10 to the start of W9, but `test_access_gate` still pointed at G-10 —
  so SR-22's guard would have released the test split at W9, three weeks before anything was frozen,
  and ER-11/ER-12 were still scheduled at W10 reading test at sweep strength. New **G-12** (test
  release, W11) closes it, and opening the test split now has a gate for the first time — it had been
  the only irreversible act in the project without one. Also swept: `docs/crossover-explained.md`'s
  hypothesis table, multiplicity arithmetic, operating-point rule and G-10 week were all stale;
  `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` counted external reviews differently, now resolved by stating in §17
  that `EXT-n` are labels rather than an ordinal count. The lesson, recorded in AM-60: a rule and the
  schedule that obeys it were edited in the same round without being read against each other, which
  is precisely what AM-47's process rule exists to prevent and precisely what it failed to catch.

- **2026-07-28 (later)** — **Codex gate audit (`EXT-6`) adjudicated; AM-57..AM-59 applied, 159 → 166
  requirements.** Verdict was project GO / W1 NOGO and it was not disputed: the defects are contract
  and evidence defects, cheap now and expensive once config and results encode them. Unlike every
  earlier round, **every checkable numeric claim reproduced exactly** — packetisation defect counts,
  the corrected canonical case, the grid arithmetic, the runtime figures, and an H4 power calculation
  (MDE ≈ 1.4 pp at 10% discordance, 3.2 pp at 50%) that no previous review attempted. One framing
  claim rejected (`run_id` "cannot pair" — it is a tuple key; the real defect is that it *collided*),
  one sharpened (the added grid points are BPSK at the noisy end, needing **fewer** code blocks, so
  the worst-case projection overstates rather than understates there). Verified against primary
  sources rather than adopted: the Sionna encoder source, for both the exact-1/3 BG1 floor and the
  fact that TS 38.212 §5.4.2.2's interleaver is applied **only** when `num_bits_per_symbol` is passed
  — which the W0 probe never did; the circular, by rendering a text-free scanned PDF; torchvision's
  current docs, which do ship an Imagenette loader this file wrongly said was absent.
  `check_packetisation.py` rewritten: four defects, zero of which its own "0 failures" surfaced.
  Estimand, H1 calibration binding, H2 intersection-union, H3 magnitude clause, `run_id`/`pair_id`/
  `noise_id` split, dataset provenance, environment lock, test-access guard, deterministic outage
  fallback, PHY seam pins, narrowed standards claim, W17 schedule, G-10 moved to W9. **Nothing now
  blocks W1.**

- **2026-07-28** — **Docs swept for staleness; AM-56 from a self-audit.** Three hand-written files
  were stale and none had been touched by the amendment rounds: `docs/crossover-explained.md` still
  claimed the cliff H2 depends on was untouched by adaptive modulation (superseded by AM-53), still
  routed the crossover fallback through G-8 rather than G-10, and still pointed at the retired
  OPT-4; `README.md` said work starts at W0; `AGENTS.md` listed the removed `core_ratio` as a
  provisional value and described supervisor sign-off as outstanding. All corrected in place with
  the supersession shown. The self-audit then found a real defect in AM-53's own work — H2's window
  selection clause still said "the classical system" when three classical curves now exist — fixed
  as AM-56, with ER-9's unspecified `transmit_dim_realised_by` factorisation recorded in §16 as a
  carried gap due before W9. All dependency pins resolved with cp314 wheels (torch 2.13.0+cu130,
  torchvision 0.28.0+cu130, scikit-image 0.26.0, pytest 9.1.1); Imagenette source verified live.
  **Nothing blocks W1.**

- **2026-07-27 (later)** — **Two external reviews adjudicated; 30 amendments applied (AM-26..AM-55),
  122 → 158 requirements.** Neither review's verdict was adopted: EXT-4's "commit after seven edits"
  understated the problem and EXT-5's blanket HOLD overstated it, since only one finding touched W1.
  Three serious defects, all found by recomputation rather than by reading: ER-9 was arithmetically
  infeasible at every operating point but one and would have sat at chance across all of H1's region
  (AM-55); TS 38.212 packetisation was non-conformant in the CRC, the code-block cap and the
  base-graph selection *order*, though segmentation changes in zero configurations so no measured
  number moves (AM-49); and ER-10 promised a variance decomposition that AM-17's zipped seeds had
  already made impossible (AM-31). Also caught: G-8 was required to decide a crossover at W6 when no
  learned model exists until W7 (AM-33, new G-10 at W10), and W9 built an entire third system with
  no gate on it (new G-11). Refuted two claims against primary sources — EXT-4's OCUDU vector
  recommendation is false and made §16's existing mitigation line false too (AM-30), and its Third
  Review rubric denominator is 60 rather than 55 (AM-46). Corrected a throughput figure that was
  faster than the evidence committed to support it (AM-29). New evidence artifact
  `spec/evidence/check_packetisation.py`; validator hardened so the dangling-vocabulary bug that
  hid `augmentation` for a whole round now fails `--check`.

- **2026-07-27** — **G-9 passed; W1 open.** Spike run to completion: all 180 configurations hit an
  exact `E_r`, 634 cb/s at 50 iterations (later corrected to the committed 625.2 by AM-29), ER-1
  projected at ~2.1 h / ~4.1 h for one and two ratios,
  smallest payload 16 bits (AM-24). Three defects found by running it rather than reading it: the
  library's LLR sign is inverted relative to `x = 1−2c` and fails *silently* at BER 0.77; nominal
  rate 1/3 was unrealizable at three live operating points against BG1's coderate floor; and the
  decoder spelling in the spec is not the one the library accepts. Golden vectors resolved beyond
  what was asked (AM-25) — Sionna matches the MATLAB-generated srsRAN vectors **bit-exactly, zero
  mismatches**, lifting sizes 2–288, both base graphs. The licensing question dissolved rather than
  being decided: the data was never committed upstream, it is a release asset, so the fixture fetches
  and verifies instead of vendoring. New carried risk: the upstream repo is archived — srsRAN became
  OCUDU in Dec 2025 — mitigated by the always-run rung-4 floor. Spec self-consistency swept
  afterwards: DEC-10 still said the fixture was a *committed* `.npz`, the ladder's rung 2 was still
  named `..._committed_testvectors`, §16's pending block was still pending, and AGENTS.md still said
  "W0 has not started" — all corrected, the rename recorded in AM-25 rather than made silently.
  Evidence folder `spec/evidence/` created so the measured claims can be checked, not trusted.
- **2026-07-25 (latest+4)** — W0 spike started; documentary half recorded as AM-23 while the torch
  install ran. TS 38.212 pinned (V17.13.0, closing AM-9); srsRAN rate-matcher and segmenter vector
  generators confirmed; §16's Python 3.14 risk rewritten after finding it was aimed at declared
  minimums rather than at CUDA wheel availability, where the actual trap is a bare `pip install
  torch` silently yielding a CPU build. BR-10's segmentation and rate-matching arithmetic verified
  at zero slack across all 72 live configurations — BR-3's equal-channel-uses claim now holds as
  arithmetic, independent of any library. New open question: srsRAN's vector data is AGPLv3, so
  vendoring it is a licensing decision.
- **2026-07-25 (latest+3)** — MATLAB licence answered: will be attempted, contingency requested.
  Added a four-rung golden-vector source ladder (AM-22) so BR-2 no longer sits behind a licence the
  project does not control, and narrowed DEC-10's AFF3CT rejection to runtime use only, since a
  one-shot fixture generator never touches CI. Rung 2 (srsRAN's committed MATLAB-derived vectors) is
  the one to confirm at W0. G-9 is now down to the LDPC spike alone.
- **2026-07-25 (latest+2)** — §2 fully dispositioned (AM-21). Completion criterion approved outright
  with "try your best for a crossover" and an explicit "if things go south, you'll be good"; the four
  hypotheses and the statistical method delegated to the author. G-9's §2 clause closed. Consequence
  worth remembering: nobody outside is checking H1–H4, so the commit history is the preregistration.
  Only the MATLAB licence and the LDPC spike remain in G-9.
- **2026-07-25 (latest+1)** — Split ER-3's operating-point selection into two thresholds (AM-20)
  after the audit found the 5 pp rule could select a ratio where no crossover exists — while ER-1,
  the only full-strength experiment, runs at exactly one ratio. Now 5 pp → efficiency point, 2 pp →
  crossover point, headline at the crossover point. Selection costs nothing extra (same sweep table);
  training costs at most three more runs; whether ER-1 doubles is deferred to G-8, because the decode
  throughput that decides it doesn't exist until the W0 spike.
- **2026-07-25 (latest)** — Supervisor ratified §2's success criterion: pursue a crossover, fall back
  to dominance-everywhere if it does not appear (AM-19). Closes the longest-lead-time G-9 item. Also
  recorded what the instruction does *not* authorise, because "try your best for a crossover" is the
  sentence most likely to be misread later as permission to weaken the learned system. Residual: was
  the sign-off on §2 whole, or the crossover clause only? The LDPC spike is now the front of the queue.
- **2026-07-25 (later)** — Adjudicated a fifth external review (ChatGPT) and applied 18 amendments
  (97 → 115 requirements). Added the §17 amendment record and the `AM` prefix, so spec changes now
  carry what-changed-and-why rather than landing silently. Adopted: §2's H2 window rule, H3 slope
  test and H1 effect size (AM-1..AM-3); ER-9 rebuilt as a shared-front-end control after the audit
  found it could not be scored at all as written (AM-5); BR-12 and λ both moved behind the gates that
  produce their inputs (AM-6, AM-7); JPEG 2000 exact-byte rate control replaced after checking the
  OpenJPEG manual (AM-8); novelty position narrowed and §16's false "no prior art" line deleted
  (AM-10). Rejected: the H1 multiplicity objection (AM-4). The internal audit found five more,
  notably ER-3 asking for 2000 validation images from splits that hold 1000 and 500 (AM-14) and ER-9
  being modulation-capped while the baseline was not (AM-15). Schedule W6–W11 resequenced.
- **2026-07-26** — Reordered "Do next": the LDPC spike moved ahead of the transparency-bitrate probe,
  which turns out to depend on a classifier that does not exist until G-1.
- **2026-07-25** — Spec revised against four external reviews (66 → 97 requirements). Rewrote §2 as
  completion-plus-hypotheses; JPEG → JPEG 2000 (DEC-9); validation-split selection (DEC-12); paired
  inference (ER-10); attribution control (ER-9); PR-1..PR-8 for rubric deliverables; fixed the
  validator's ID-contiguity bug and added tombstones. Settled DEC-10 (Sionna) and DEC-16 (adaptive
  modulation + fallback). Added `docs/crossover-explained.md`.
